         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Wherefore, we ſhall do very well, exactly to
<pb facs="tcp:164278:3"/> ſearch and inquire, which of theſe three principal, divided, and diſſenting Churches is guilty or innocent of ſuch a prejudicial Schiſm and Separation, to the end, that we may know and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which ſide to imbrace and give aſſent unto, and which not. And that the true, undeniable, orthodoxal Doctrine and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the true Evangelical Reformed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> may not be condemned and rejected by any incompetent Judge as falſe, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous, heretical, and damnable, in regard that Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical matters are commonly as much obnoxious to ill managing, as Civil and Temporal: It is by all means expedient and requiſite for us to repaire to ſuch a Judge, who betwixt us and others may determine and decide the Controverſie and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference by an infallible Sentence, from which we cannot appeal. And whereas the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do attribute ſuch full and abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, or, as they declare it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the Supream Head of the Church, either himſelf alone, or with aſſiſtance of a Councel of Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Prelates, depending on him and repreſenting the whole Univerſal Church: I am perſwaded we with all <hi>Chriſtian Proteſtants,</hi> cannot, nor will ſubmit to any other Judge in matters of Religion, but to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> or to the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who in his <hi>Sacred Word</hi> hath preſcribed his Will and Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, which we onely, cloſely and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively muſt adhere and ſtick unto. For this Volume of the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> (I mean not any other Books, more, or leſſe, then thoſe that by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt were written of the Prophets and Apoſtles and left to the Primitive Church, which from it were ſpred amongſt all Nations and in the middeſt of darkneſſe and unfaithful hereſies by Gods ſingular Providence preſerved and in their original Tongues conveyed unto us) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indubitable Word of God, whoſe Divine Power, Light, Vertue, and Operation all true Beleevers feel in their hearts and conſciences, and containing (though not the deciſion of all Theological Queſtions and Controverſies) yet all Articles of Faith and Doctrine, neceſſary for every true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Salvation; It is manifeſt, that the Church, or they that have the charge over it, whether they be called Popes, Cardinals, Biſhops, or Divines and Teachers, or general Councels, have not any power and juriſdiction to decide, determine, and wreſt the Doctrines to their arbitrary judgement and pleaſure, but onely a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb facs="tcp:164278:3"/> function to teach and demonſtrate by Warrant from the Word of God whether and how they are decided in it; neither to force their doubtful and undecided Opinions upon any man <hi>ſub Anathemate</hi> or Excommunication, unleſſe he ſhould reject the Word of God in any fundamental and neceſſary Article of Faith or plain Declaration thereof, or cry up his own errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and controverted opinions, interpretations, conſequences, and inferences for the Word of God it ſelf and neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith to the diſturbance and diſtraction of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>And this is that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> caſt continually into the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Reformed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> teeth, That notwithſtanding they ſtill refer themſelves to the perfect and infallible Rule of the Word of God; yet for all this they will be themſelves infallible Judges by obſtructing and impoſing their own particular expoſitions and inferences on others. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> indeed, eſpecially which are called <hi>Lutherani rigidi</hi> the groſſer ſort (who are ſo ſtrictly addicted <hi>Formulae Concordiae Saxonicae,</hi> that they bind not onely their Faith and Doctrine unto it, but alſo all others that diſſent from them in their particular interpretations and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, principally in the Point of <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body and its oral manducation, by excluding them from the Communion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of Publick Offices and Dignities,) as long as they do obſtinately perſiſt in their arrogant judging and condemning, will have a very hard task to clear themſelves of this charge. The Vindication of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Reformed Churches, how that they onely depend on the Word of God and not on any mans interpretation and opinion, much leſſe preſume to impoſe them on others as neceſſary unto Salvation, but impart and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every one the due Libertie of Conſcience without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the true Limits and Rules of Gods Truth and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Charity, hath been of late ſufficiently and punctually for the true and better information of them that are miſinformed, exhibited in <hi>high Dutch</hi> (by <hi>D. John Bergius,</hi> Chaplaine to His Highneſſe the Prince Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> Author of this Treatiſe, One of the beſt Learned Divines <hi>Germany</hi> at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affordeth, a primitive <hi>Catholick Chriſtian</hi> and down-right <hi>Proteſtant,</hi>) in ſuch a plain and perſpicuous way, that even the moſt ignorant and unlearned, who are not able to peruſe great
<pb facs="tcp:164278:4"/> Volumes, may palpably ſee and perceive the falſehood and ſlanders that are laid at all <hi>Chriſtian Proteſtants</hi> doors: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, ſince the Reformed <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches cannot hope for any Eccleſiaſtical Peace and Unitie both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, whileſt the vehemency and fierceneſſe in judging and condemning of the ſaid <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> is not appeaſed and mitigated. He repreſenteth and declareth to them an <hi>Infallible Apoſtolical Direction and Rule</hi> in general, what and how far men are bound in conſcience to judge and not to judge in matters of Religion, and then by way of application; How far they ought to judge the <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion, or to ſeparate themſelves from them, or to reform them.</p>
            <p>Which Treatiſe having been ſo happy to peruſe by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of my worthy Friend and Countrey-man Maſter <hi>Jaſpar Godeman</hi> (whom I always in his frequent converſation perceived a ſingular Well-wiſher to an Eccleſiaſtical Unitie,) I have immediately betaken my ſelf to the Tranſlation thereof, much animated and incouraged by his and divers others good advice, accompanied with theſe two pregnant Motives:</p>
            <p>The <hi>One:</hi> That this ſubject is the moſt neceſſary and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table of all Theological Controverſies and Queſtions, that now adayes are in agitation, and may much conduce, if not to the advancement of an Univerſal Peace and Unitie of all Churches (which though it was always earneſtly deſired of men truely zealous and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſo that Learned <hi>Calvin</hi> offering his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice therein to that worthy man Doctor <hi>Cranmer,</hi> ſaid, It would not grieve him to ſaile over ten Seas to ſuch a purpoſe, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a work of inſuperable difficultie and altogether impoſſible in mens eyes,) at leaſt to promote the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> agreement and reconciliation or mitigation of the diſtractions of all Kingdoms, Principalities, and Free-States that have abandoned the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions and pernicious Leaven of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; For the effecting whereof not onely the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches and Divines in <hi>Germany</hi> have had in former times ſeveral Conferences at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg, Wittenberg,</hi> and of late at <hi>Leipzig;</hi> but alſo at theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times that Famous and Reverend Divine Maſter <hi>John Durey</hi> (firſt ſtirred up by that excellent Inſtrument Maſter <hi>James Gode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Father of the worthy Gentleman aforementioned, One of His Majeſty the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Privy Counſellor and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb facs="tcp:164278:4"/> of his Court of Appellations in the Precinct of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> and then ſeconded with hearty wiſhes tnd prayers of many pious and learned Divines in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>) hath theſe fifteen yeers to my knowledge, imployed his indefatigable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and ſingular induſtry in <hi>Germany, Sweden, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and not without hopeful ſucceſſe, having at length prevailed ſo much with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Sweden,</hi> that they not onely have given over their ſlanders and calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Pulpit, but alſo are contented to be called <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Proteſtants,</hi> agreeing with us in the mean time in the name, and walking by the ſame Rule ſo far as they have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till God reveal unto them what is remaining.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Other</hi> Motive is, That alſo this ſubject would be moſt ſeaſonable for theſe tempeſtuous and turbulent times, which the Church and State of <hi>England</hi> at this preſent groaneth and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth under, and which, if we will ſeriouſly inquire into, doth proceed originally from no other cauſe then uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and acrimony in judging and condemning one another: And conſequently (Reverend Sirs) it will be uſeful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for every one in particular, whereby (being perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture carried away with raſhneſſe and vehemency, as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all men are inclined and prone unto, to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others as unfaithful, that erre rather out of humane weakneſſe and meer ignorance, then obſtinacy and malice in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matters, and in the circumſtance) much good he may here learn and be adviſed how to moderate and temperate his paſſions and affections with more charity and peaceableneſſe and ſtedfaſtly maintain the benefit of the ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Chriſtian ſaving Faith and ſincere love and obedience of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the onely fundamental and neceſſary Doctrine unto Salvation, leſt in raſhly, preſumptuouſly, and rigorouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning others, he may be inexcuſable and condemn himſelf: And contrarywiſe, being either thruſt out of the way, which the Lord our God hath commanded him to walk in, or falſly and contumeliouſly judged, ſlandered, reviled, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and perſecuted for the true Orthodoxal Doctrine, Faith, and Religion by an incompetent Judge on Earth, he may know, without beleeving and obeying their words, and offending thereby both his own and other true beleeving or erring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, how to appeal firſt to the Word of God it ſelf and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
<pb facs="tcp:164278:5"/> conſent of the Primitive Apoſtolical Church, or to any legal and impartial Eccleſiaſtical Convocation, Synod, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, or if he cannot be heard there, to the Supream Judge in Heaven himſelf, being the onely Law-giver, who is able to ſave and deſtroy, and in his good time will judge thoſe Judges themſelves, and pronounce a definitive Sentence againſt all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Schiſms, and Diviſions, and eſtabliſh an Univerſal Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Unitie in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Whereas now theſe two Motives have induced me to this ſlender endeavour, without regard to any other intereſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but that which might be conducible to the advancement of an Eccleſiaſtical Peace and Unitie amongſt <hi>Evangelical Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Churches, leſt the Wel-wiſhers and Furtherers thereof might not be too long debarr'd from the luſtre and uſe of ſo rare a Jewel; I thought fit and expedient to dedicate it to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, as being ſuteable and adequate to your zeal and piety (relying herein upon Sir <hi>Edwin Sandys</hi> judgement delivered in his Book called <hi>A View of the ſtate of Religion in the Weſtern parts of the World,</hi> pag. 173. where he writeth thus: <hi>The end of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Evangelical Proteſtant Churches will be, that their enemies ſhall laugh, when themſelves ſhall have cauſe to weep, unleſſe the graciouſneſſe of God ſtir up ſome worthy Princes of renown and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on both ſides to interpoſe their Wiſdom, Industry, and Authority for the uniting theſe Factions, or at leaſt for reconciling and compoſing thoſe differences in ſome tolerable ſort; A work of immortal fame and deſert, and worthy of none but them of whom this wicked baſe World is not worthy:</hi> And hoping that this weak attempt of my labour, though ſome of the Vulgar ſort will perhaps either careleſly or cenſoriouſly entertain it, will be nevertheleſſe as favourably accepted by you, as it is affectionately and heartily tendred by</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:164278:7"/> 
                     <hi>to forgive</hi> him willingly and from the bottom of our heart, which is the moſt neceſſary and difficult work of Charity, without which no Sacrifice, nor Alms will be acceptable to God, and whereof we are put in minde daily in the Lords Prayer: but alſo in all other <hi>treſpaſſes</hi> againſt God and men, not to <hi>judge</hi> him raſhly, much leſſe <hi>condemn</hi> him; as our Saviour doth teach us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37; where he comprehendeth all the works of Charity in theſe four words; <hi>Judge not, condemn not, Forgive, give.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>firſt,</hi> We ought <hi>not to judge</hi> him <hi>in his ſins,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from humane infirmitie and ignorance, but rather excuſe him as much as lies in our power. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ought not ſuddenly <hi>to condemn</hi> him in ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, which are committed more out of an inexcuſable malice then weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but rather uſe all our poſſible endeavours to convert him, and ſave his ſoul from death and damnation. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ought to <hi>forgive</hi> him with all our heart thoſe ſins he hath committed againſt us. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We ought alſo to <hi>give</hi> to him, and ſupply willingly all his wants. And thus we ſhall fulfil all the works of Chriſtian Love and Charity. To which the Lord in the ſaid Chapter doth earneſtly exhort us by three ſtrong and efficacious Motives. 1. By the example of our heavenly Father, to whem We, being his children, muſt conform our ſelves, eſpecially in love and compaſſion: <hi>Be ye merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful.</hi> 2. By the promiſe of a proportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration; If we do not judge nor condemn, God will not judge nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us; if we forgive, God will forgive us alſo: If we give and willingly aſſiſt others, God will forgive and relieve us alſo, and not ſparingly, but libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and abundantly: Finally, in every thing, <hi>With the ſame meaſure that we mete withal, it ſhall be meaſured unto us again.</hi> 3. By the repreſentation of our faults and weakneſſes, which he ſetteth out by Three ſimilitudes: Of one <hi>blinde perſon</hi> leading another which is likewiſe blinde: Of <hi>a Master,</hi> who will have his diſciple more learned and perfect then himſelf: Of <hi>a Phyſitian</hi> or <hi>Oculiſt,</hi> who will pull out the mote of another man's eye, when he himſelf hath a beam in his own eye: Leſt we may not preſume to Judge and condemn others in their ways; or to hate and forſake others, when yet we our ſelves are many times blinde and ſtand in need of a good maſter and guide: nor to upbraid others with their indiſcretion and imperfections, when We our ſelves are in many things indiſcreet and imperfect maſters: neither to finde ſo great fault with other mens motes in their eyes: or to undertake ſo boldly the pulling out, when many times by the cure of the motes of our brother, We our ſelves thruſt into our own eye a ſtrong and great beam of Hypocriſie, Spiritual pride, Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Self-love, without perceiving it at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What ſort of Judging is prohibited and what not.</note>Nevertheleſſe this ſort of Judging which the Lord ſpeaketh of, is not ſo meant or to be underſtood, as if all judging in general were prohibited and unlawful: For he doth not thereby prohibit the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> and <hi>Judicature</hi> whereby the Magiſtrates do judge and condemn Delinquents, in God's ſtead; and whereby the Church, or the Miniſters and Elders of the Church in Chriſt's ſtead do judge ſcandalous members: nor <hi>the Judging of Conſcience,</hi> whereby every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to judge and diſcern aright in his own Conſcience good from evil, truth from falſhood, juſtice from injuſtice, that he may know both in doctrine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:164278:7"/> and life what to believe and not to believe, what to do and what to eſchew. Such manner of Judging is not onely not prohibited, but often commanded; Joh. 7.24. <hi>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgement.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, God judgeth.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.15. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1. <hi>Try the ſpirits, whether they are of God.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> But Chriſt's meaning was to prohibit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>all Preſumptuous judging of other men,</hi> as far as it is repugnant to <hi>love and charitie,</hi> or to <hi>juſtice and truth:</hi> When we preſume to be our neighbours Judges, 1. <hi>In regard of his ſins,</hi> and that when we judge him either <hi>by his afflictions,</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and ſufferings; like as <hi>Job</hi> was judged by his friends, and <hi>David</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, eſpecially in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41, crieth out againſt ſuch judging of his enemies or falſe friends: or <hi>by his words and works,</hi> when we either make the worſt conſtruction or ſenſe of that which was not ſo evil meant, ſpoken and done, whereas we might have extracted and made the beſt of it, and excuſed it: or when we exaſperate too much the defects and faults proceeding out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane infirmity, and ſo make huge and vaſt beams of the leaſt motes; or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon falſe and ill grounded ſlanders and calumnies, that which is uncertain yet (if not altogether forged) whether it was thus ſpoken, done and meant. 2. <hi>In regard of the very thoughts of his heart, minde and intentions,</hi> againſt his own words and works, meerly out of a malicious ſuſpition to render him odious and contemptible to others; or when we will needs judge him in matters though certain and evil enough, yet with little or no reſpect either to his or our own good: or laſtly, when we are not contented to judge his ſins, but even preſume to ſit down in God's Tribunal pronouncing ſentence againſt his ſoul, and condemn it to hell it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All</hi> this preſumptuous, uncharitable, unjuſt and unprofitable judging, is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by Chriſt, and extendeth to all ſins in worldly buſineſſes and ordinary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral affairs; <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch as are incident to words or works of the Second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and much more to all ſins in matters of God's ſervice and Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> to the words and works of the Firſt Table.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Again,</hi> he enjoyneth theſe Two duties, being the chief and moſt requiſite works of charity, that we ſhould not judge others, but rather excuſe them; not condemn, but rather further and hope for their amendment, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, the other Two duties which conſiſt in Forgiving and Giving, cannot be well performed: Yea, he doth in this order preſſe the aforeſaid duties, becauſe by ſuch judging and condemning as he forbiddeth, moſt commonly, though unjuſtly, occaſion is taken by many to conceive that they are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to any charity at all towards criminous perſons, nor to forgive them their ſins, neither to give unto them nor help them in their wants; but rather to reſiſt them in every thing, and to hate and perſecute them to the uttermoſt: <hi>Act.</hi> 26.9, 11.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to which evil apprehenſion, our Lord Chriſt alleadgeth againſt ſuch unſeaſonable judging this notable and familiar place of Scripture, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. <hi>I deſired mercy and not ſacrifice;</hi> and giveth eſpecially this leſſon to the Phariſees and Scribes, to be learned by them, who did tranſgreſſe it moſt of all: <hi>Matth.</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:164278:8"/> 9.11. <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercie and not ſacrifice:</hi> and Matth. 12.7. <hi>If ye had known what this meaneth, you would not have condemned the guiltleſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Unſeaſonable and raſh Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a grievous ſin.</note>And although this be in it ſelf the eaſieſt work of Charity (for what is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a man then to abſtain and withhold himſelf from judging, the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof is the moſt difficult and dangerous work in the world, and pertaineth properly to God alone?) yet it is the hardeſt work by reaſon of the perverſeneſſe of mans heart; and ſome finde it more difficult then to forgive their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moreover,</hi> Unſeaſonable and tenacious judging is not without reaſon eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the <hi>moſt common,</hi> the <hi>moſt pernicious,</hi> and yet the <hi>moſt hidden</hi> and <hi>ſecret Vice</hi> of all ſins and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt common:</hi> Becauſe we are all generally ſwayed by a natural procli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity rather to judge and cenſure other men then our ſelves; And all ſorts of men, high and lowe, of what dignity and degree ſoever, are obnoxious to this Uncharitableneſſe. The moſt ſupreme Magiſtrates and Rulers of this world, Kings and Princes, whom God hath ordained to be Judges over other men, muſt give way often to be very injuſtly judged and cenſured, not onely by their enemies, but even by their own ſervants and ſubjects. Preachers and Miniſters of God's Word, not onely by their Adverſaries, but even by their fellow-bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Auditors. The moſt godly by the moſt ungodly: The wiſeſt by the moſt fooliſh: Yea, God himſelf in heaven is oftentimes judged and blamed by fools and mad-men on the earth: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt pernicious:</hi> For whilſt we reprove others, we forget to judge our ſelves, though this be the moſt neceſſary and profitable judging: yea, <hi>wherein we judge others, we condemn our ſelves,</hi> Rom. 2.1. And all ſorts of calamities and miſeries amongſt men; all diſorders, diſtempers, diſtractions, differences and diſſentions in every eſtate, in Common-wealths, in Chriſtian Churches, even in Families, if we ſeriouſly ſearch thereinto, proceed originally from no other ground, but from an Unſeaſonable, raſh, uncharitable, and injuſt judging one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The moſt ſecret:</hi> Becauſe it happeneth not onely in words and works, but many times in the very thoughts, as in thoſe to whom our Saviour ſayeth, <hi>Wherefore think you evil in your hearts?</hi> Matth 9.4. And then it comes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly under the colour and appearance of ſingular zeal towards Juſtice, truth, and the honour of God; and withal under pretence of love and charity to pull out the more out of our brother's eye: From whence it is, that it is not counted for a ſin or vice at all; but rather paſſeth for a commendable vertue, for a good, holy, profitable, yea ſometimes for a neceſſary work; whilſt many Imagine that they muſt judge and condemn, leſt otherwiſe they ſhould be judged and condemned by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Eſpecially in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>Which Unjuſt judging, if it be a dangerous and pernicious Vice in any temporal and worldly matters; certainly it muſt needs be more prejudicial and dangerous in <hi>matters of Religion</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> as being of the greateſt moment and importance, in regard all differences, contentions, diſſentions, ſlanders; all vain and ſwelling babling, all ſcholaſtical and profane Controverſies, all fooliſh and unprofitable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:164278:8"/> queſtions and literal diſputes, which we are admoniſhed ſo often by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to avoid; In like manner, all enmitie, hatred, envie and bitterneſſe which ariſe from them; And laſtly, all Hereſies, Schiſms, Sects, Separation, and the deſtruction of the Univerſal Chriſtian Church, do originally proceed from nothing more then from ſuch Uncharitable judging and condemning.</p>
                  <p>Wherein in theſe later days, more then in former, not onely the vulgar and ignorant People, but even moſt of all thoſe that ſhould admoniſh others, <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divines,</hi> have tranſgreſſed, and thereby given much occaſion to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent lamentable devaſtation and deſtruction of Chriſtendom, and wrought ſo much already with the greateſt part of the Chriſtians by ſuch judging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions ariſing from the ſame, that in ſtead of true Godlineſſe and Chriſtian Charitie, which ſhould be the onely ſcope and fruit of Chriſtian Doctrine, at this preſent the Chriſtian Religion is turned almoſt into a meer diſceptation and debate of words, which at length may open a door to the Contempt of all Religion and Univerſal Atheiſm, as it is already in ſeveral places apparently manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>And although amongſt theſe modern contentious Divines ſome are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant then other, yet none of them ſhall be able ſo fully to excuſe and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate themſelves, but they will be found to have ſometimes tranſgreſſed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and moderation of Chriſtian Charitie.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we all have great need to repeat and ruminate again on Chriſt's old Leſſon; <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth; I will have mercy and not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the apprehenſion and learning of which, none can give us better dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who during his ignorance was alſo ſuch a zealous and vehement judge; but afterwards, when God had ſhewed mercy unto him, did the more faithfully dehort others from it: eſpecially the <hi>Romanes,</hi> in his moſt excellent Epiſtle to them, thorow the Whole Fourteenth Chapter, the chief ſum and argument whereof is comprehended in Verſe 13. <hi>Wherefore let us not judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block, or occaſion to fall, in his brothers way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words, if we do examine the Coherence by the precedent and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Verſes, the Apoſtle collecteth for us Two moſt neceſſary Rules:</p>

                  <p>IN the beginning of the Fourteenth Chapter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them; <hi>Him that is weak in the faith, receive you, but not to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful disputations.</hi> The Greek Text hath <gap reason="foreign">

The Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Verſion, <hi>Non diſceptationes cogitationum.</hi> Beza, <hi>Non ad altercationes diſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptationum;</hi> that is, not to a debate of diſputes: or, as ſome expound it more properly with <hi>Auguſtine; Not to judging of thoughts;</hi> that is to ſay, Do not ſet your ſelves as judges over his thoughts, to reject him becauſe of his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of faith.</p>
                  <p>Which afterwards he applieth chiefly to thoſe, who, though they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Goſpel of Chriſt, and believed to obtain ſalvation by his grace; yet <hi>did obſerve the diſtinction of days and meats,</hi> or made a ſcruple whether they might eat ſuch meat without ſin and offence, which God himſelf had forbidden in the Law: Though ſome will have underſtood thereby <hi>the meats offered to Idols;</hi> concerning which, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, he teacheth almoſt the very ſame Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Where the Apoſtle exhorteth thoſe that were ſtrong in faith, who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient knowledge that ſuch diſtinctions of meats and days in the Law, were now not any more requiſite according the Goſpel in Chriſt, but were a meer indifferent thing; that they nevertheleſſe ſhould not contemn or condemn ſuch as were weak in faith, who had not yet the knowledge of their liberty, or were doubtful of it; nor ſhould judge their thoughts why they did abſtain from ſuch meats, but receive them in love and charitie.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, he giveth to them both this Rule, Verſ. 3. <hi>Let him that eateth</hi> (underſtand every thing, by reaſon of the libertie of the Goſpel) <hi>not despiſe him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not</hi> (every thing, by reaſon that he thinketh the difference of meats according to the Law to be neceſſary, or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereof) <hi>judge him that eateth: For God hath received him</hi> (in the Goſpel.) <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? To his own maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi> Which he repeateth over again in the Tenth verſe; <hi>But why doest thou judge thy brother?</hi> (that eateth every thing) <hi>or why doeſt thou ſet at nought thy brother</hi> (that eateth not?) <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement-ſeat of Christ, where every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God.</hi> Whereupon theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:164278:9"/> words follow: <hi>Let us not therefore judge one another any more; viz.</hi> in ſuch a manner whereby we ſhould reject one another, and not receive one another in things that are not neceſſary and indifferent, and notwithſtanding are accounted to be neceſſary by ſome, out of their weakneſſe of faith.</p>
                  <p>Out of which words and diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, we frame this general Rule and Doctrine; <hi>That in thoſe things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A General Rule wherein we ought not to Judge one another.</note> 
                     <hi>which in themſelves are not neceſſary for ſalvation, though by ſome they are counted to be neceſſary, none ſhall judge or condemn the other; but one ought to tolerate and receive the other in love and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as brethren that are weak in faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Rule is of great force and validity, as well in matters that we ought to <hi>believe</hi> as <hi>practiſe:</hi> For both were called into queſtion by the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Apoſtles times: Some believed, that it was requiſite to make a diſtinction of meats, and therefore did not eat every thing: Others believed and counted it unneceſſary, and therefore did eat every thing promiſcuouſly: Both did alſo herein rely upon the Word of God: Thoſe, <hi>upon the bare and ſimple let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law:</hi> Theſe, <hi>upon the liberty of the Goſpel,</hi> according to which they did declare the true meaning of the Law, which they had received from Chriſt and the Apoſtles. And although thoſe did greatly erre in the letter of the Law, which was not intended for the times of the Kingdom of Chriſt among the Gentiles, but had its reference onely to the Old Teſtament: Yet the Apoſtle will that none ſhall judge, deſpiſe or reject the other, neither in their faith, nor works; but receive him as a weak brother in faith.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto this Obſervation ought to be annexed, That the Apoſtle doth ſpeak onely of thoſe, who out of meer <hi>weakneſſe</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> to tranſgreſſe the Law, made it a matter of neceſſity, or at leaſt a ſcruple of it: to whom it would have been ſin, if they had eaten of the forbidden meat againſt their own (though erroneous) conſciences; according to the doctrine of the Apoſtle, Verſe 23. <hi>He that doubteth, is damned if he eat (viz.</hi> againſt his own conſcience) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe be eateth not of faith: for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thoſe that rather out of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>obſtinacie,</hi> then out of meer weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and fear, did make it neceſſary, after ſuch a manner that they not onely for themſelves believed and did it; but alſo enforced it upon the believers among the Gentiles, as neceſſary to their own and other mens ſalvation, without any true ground from Gods Word; and conſequently, beſides the diſtinction of meats and days, did preſſe upon them the neceſſity of the whole Ceremonial Law, Circumciſion, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore condemned and reviled the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and others, as enemies to the Law, who did faithfully maintain and defend the liberty of the Goſpel: Thoſe, I ſay, the Apoſtle, by the vertue of his Apoſtleſhip, hath very earneſtly judged, reproved and condemned; yea, ſtigmatized and branded with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> eſpecially in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> Chap. 1. verſ. 8, 9. <hi>If any man, though an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you then that ye have received</hi> (by us Apoſtle) <hi>let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed;</hi> even for this reaſon, becauſe they judged moſt preſumptuouſly the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers amongſt the Gentiles and the Apoſtles themſelves, and diſturbed and ſcandalized thereby the Chriſtian Congregation, ſo that they introduced a quite <hi>other Goſpel,</hi> according to which they thought to be juſtified and ſaved
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:164278:10"/> by the works of the Law, and not by the grace and mercy of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing he hath thus cenſured thoſe, which were ſo zealous for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Moſaical Law; how much more then deſerve thoſe to be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that enforced the traditions and commandments of men for doctrines ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto ſalvation? <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3, 9. And yet how much more thoſe, who under the name of Gods Word do introduce erroneous, or even Superſtitious and Idolatrous Doctrine and Worſhip as neceſſary unto ſalvation? Whereof we ſhall ſpeak more in the ſecond Part.</p>
                  <p>At this preſent let us principally conſider and apply this firſt Rule, wherein a Chriſtian ought not to judge and condemn another, but rather receive and tolerate him as a weak brother in the faith: <hi>Namely, in ſuch articles of faith and life, which either in themſelves or by Gods Will and Commandment are not neceſſary unto ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And not onely in theſe, that are generally agreed on not to be neceſſary, but alſo in ſuch <hi>which by ſome either out of weakneſſe of knowledge, or out of fear to ſin, are eſteemed to be neceſſary, though they are not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe with this Caution, that they reciprocally do <hi>not judge nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> in ſuch pretended neceſſary Points of theirs, other Chriſtians, which will not allow of them to be ſo neceſſary nor ſo true and reaſonable. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this unjuſt judging and condemning would be damnable in themſelves, eſpecially if it ſhould be done with Uncharitableneſſe and Obſtinacie.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but the Modern Diſſenting parties will condeſcend and aſſent without any difficulty to this Doctrine: for none of them will have laid to his charge, that he did judge and condemn his Adverſary for Unneceſſary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but every thing muſt aſſume the name of neceſſary Articles of Saving Doctrine and Worſhip, wherein their Yea and Nay<note place="margin">Yea and Nay.</note> muſt neceſſarily be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But even theſe are the hinges whereon all the Differences and Diſputes will hang; <hi>What properly is neceſſary and not neceſſary unto ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For although the Apoſtle teacheth us not to judge one another in thoſe things, <hi>which one Partie eſteemeth neceſſary, though in themſelves they are not:</hi> yet it doth not follow, that we ought not to judge in matters <hi>which one Partie holdeth not neceſſary, or unlawful, though they are in themſelves neceſſary:</hi> But we muſt neceſſarily judge, that he cannot be ſaved who rejecteth a Doctrine or Worſhip as not neceſſary and unlawful, which yet of it ſelf is neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, before I proceed to the Application, I think it very requiſite to declare briefly, and as much as will conduce to this purpoſe, What is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and not neceſſary unto ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>WHat is neceſſary or not neceſſary to believe and do for to be ſaved, may be conſidered either in regard of the <hi>matter</hi> it ſelf, which we of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ought to believe and to do; or in reſpect of the <hi>Perſons,</hi> who of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ought to believe and to do them: or according to the revealed <hi>Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Degrees and diſtinctions of the neceſſity of Doctrines. 1. In regard of the Doctrine it ſelf.</note> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infallible <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> whereby we know, what we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the doctrine and matter of Faith and Life it ſelf,</hi> we muſt exactly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh what is <hi>neceſſary unto ſalvation,</hi> directè &amp; per ſe, <hi>abſolutely and by it ſelf,</hi> wherein our ſalvation doth properly conſiſt, and without which none may be ſaved; and what is neceſſary but <hi>reductivè, mediatè, conſequenter;</hi> ſo far ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as <hi>of neceſſitie it followeth</hi> and dependeth from that which is directly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or doth of neceſſity cohere with it.</p>
                  <p>For example: <hi>The Faith in Jeſus Christ which worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. 1 Cor. 3.11. 1 Cor. 2.2. 2 Tim. 1.13. 1 Joh. 3.23. (as it is generally confeſſed by all that call on the Name of Chriſt) <hi>is in it ſelf</hi> and directly neceſſary; and with it every thing wherein properly and eſſentially this ſaving faith, love and obedience of Chriſt doth conſiſt; without which no man can have true lively faith in Chriſt: which alſo properly is called <hi>The fundamental Doctrine</hi> of faith and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But by a neceſſary conſequence,</hi> all other Doctrines of Faith and life which from this Fundamental doctrine, by exact and neceſſary Theological Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Inferences may be derived and grounded thereon, are alſo in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Which are likewiſe <hi>of Two ſorts.</hi> Some are deduced by ſo <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> a conſequence from the Fundamental doctrine and the Undoubted Word of God, that every underſtanding and knowing Chriſtian may eaſily conceive them, and no man can reject them, unleſſe he rejecteth alſo the Fundamental doctrine whereon they manifeſtly depend. Some, though they are alſo derived from the Fundamental doctrine of Gods Word; yet their conſequence is <hi>not ſo evident,</hi> that every Chriſtian, but onely Divines and men that are well verſed in the Word of God, may conceive it: Yea, ſome Doctrines yet are not for every Divine's capacitie, but onely for thoſe, who by a ſpecial illumination from God are endued with a more excellent knowledge of the heavenly myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries before others: Which therefore are not neceſſary for all to know, or to do; becauſe they may retain the Neceſſary Fundamental doctrine and the ſaying Faith and love of Chriſt, though either they do not know and conceive at all ſuch derived points of doctrine by reaſon of the infirmitie and ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their underſtanding, or call them in queſtion by ſome pretended exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, or reject them quite.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:164278:11"/>
                  <p>And from theſe laſt ſort of doctrines ariſeth almoſt all the Contention: When one will judge the other for that, what for his part he deduceth and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth as neceſſary, from the Fundamental doctrine; but the other will either hold it for not neceſſary, or for erroneous and unlawful; inſomuch that ſome either out of a meer miſtake and miſapprehenſion, or carnal affections, do ſo obſtinately adhere and cleave to thoſe pretended neceſſary derived points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that they will make Fundamental points of them: yea, ſome are ſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant herein, that if they do not quite deny the Fundamental points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, at leaſt they do obſcure and pervert one or other Article of them. Which otherwiſe are ſo clearly and perſpicuouſly expreſſed in the Undoubted Word of God, by the Prophets and Apoſtles, that they cannot be denied or queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Chriſtian but him that is clouded and blinded by his affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. In reſpect of perſons.</note>Wherefore in the Second place we muſt diſcern what is neceſſary or not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in reſpect of the Perſons. For there are ſome <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> or according to the Greek, <hi>Catholike Doctrines,</hi> which are neceſſary for all Chriſtians to know, and <hi>at all times,</hi> eſpecially in the Primitive Church of the Apoſtles have been unanimouſly received, taught, and believed by all true Chriſtians: as the aforementioned Fundamental doctrine of ſalvation, with all that is evidently and undoubtedly depending from it; ſo that no man can reject it without he rejecteth alſo the Fundamental doctrine it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But ſome are but <hi>Theological Doctrines,</hi> which are not neceſſary for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but onely for ſome to know, to whom God hath imparted before others a fuller meaſure of knowledge, and more excellent gifts and charge; from whom alſo he will require more then of others, according to the rule of Chriſt, <hi>To whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall be much required,</hi> Luk. 12.48.</p>
                  <p>So that it is ſufficient for one to know and to believe onely implicitely in the principal <hi>General Articles,</hi> that what another doth know and believe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely in many <hi>Special Points</hi> which are comprehended therein. For the one, that he ſhould believe and do that which <hi>in it ſelf</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> is <hi>neceſſary unto ſalvation;</hi> for the other, that which he knoweth to be <hi>conſequently</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or to be inſeparably annexed thereunto: Yea, for one it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> many Truths, whereof he hath good ground and knowledge, out of the Word of God; which nevertheleſſe for another, who wanteth ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are either not ſo neceſſary, or not ſo profitable, to believe without ground; yet are <hi>neceſſary, not to deny or contradict them obſtinately out of carnal affections;</hi> becauſe he cannot but have leſſe ground to deny them, and rather ought to ſearch the Truth diligently in the fear and worſhip of God, and to be ready to receive and acknowledge it with thankfulneſſe, when it is demonſtrated unto him out of the Word of God: Otherwiſe the Obſtinate <hi>denying</hi> (which is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and inconſiſtent with true faith and love to Chriſt and his Word, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth meerly from carnal affections, whereby the underſtanding in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth is darkened and eclipſed) would prove damnable unto him not onely by reaſon of the errour it ſelf, but rather becauſe of his Obſtinacie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and principally, we muſt diſcern what is neceſſary or not neceſſary in regard of the revealed <hi>Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. In regard of the revealed Word of God.</note> being the <hi>rule and means</hi> whereby we may know what we ought to believe and to do.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:164278:11"/>
                  <p>Which Word, though properly there is nor ought to be but onely one, yet is delivered to the Believers in a Twofold manner, <hi>by Preaching, and Writing:</hi> From whence we muſt diſtinctly conſider. Whether and how far <hi>the written Word of God,</hi> and whether and how far the <hi>preached</hi> and miniſterial Word, or <hi>the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and doctrines of the Church</hi> and their teachers, ought to be the rule of our Faith and life.</p>
                  <p>But ſince this is the Point that principally is controverted and debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Romane Catholikes and the Evangelical Proteſtants; we intend at this preſent to lay down the ground-work of that which is undoubtedly agreed on by both Parties.</p>
                  <p>As firſt of all, That <hi>the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles of the Old and New Teſtament,</hi> which we on all ſides acknowledge and receive for Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, are the undoubted Word of God, and the perfect and infallible <hi>rule of our Faith and life;</hi> and that conſequently every thing that is taught in them ſo clearly and manifeſtly, that every underſtanding Chriſtian certainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly may know and conceive it, muſt be neceſſary for all unto ſalvation: ſo that though they do not know <hi>explicitè</hi> and particularly all things; yet are ready to believe and receive undoubtedly all things, aſſoon at they do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of the Articles we muſt <hi>believe</hi> unto ſalvation, is briefly collected in the <hi>Apoſtolical Creed,</hi> into which all Chriſtians are baptized and received as fellow-members of the Chriſtian Church: What we muſt <hi>Morally</hi> do, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited <hi>in the Commandments of the Firſt and Second Table</hi> concerning the love and duty towards God and our neighbour: But what we muſt <hi>Ceremonially and Sacramentally perform,</hi> is contained in the words of the Inſtitution of <hi>the holy Baptiſm and the bleſſed Communion or Supper of the Lord,</hi> being the Two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New Teſtament, ordained by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as it is generally and undoubtedly agreed on: And laſtly, what we ought <hi>to deſire</hi> and ask of God, is included in <hi>the Lords Prayer.</hi> In which Five Fundamental Points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, <hi>viz. in tribus Symbolis doctrinalibus credendorum, faciendorum, petendorum,</hi> what we ought to believe, to do and to ask, and <hi>in duobus Symbolis Sacramentalibus regenerationis &amp; nutritionis ſpiritualis;</hi> how we ought to be regenerated, and as Children of God in Chriſt ſpiritually nouriſhed unto a new and eternal life, doth conſiſt the whole Catechiſm, which we for our part think generally neceſſary for all Chriſtians; yet all is to be underſtood in that ſenſe, which is moſt clearly taught and expreſſed in the Scripture; yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whatſoever ſo evidently and neceſſarily doth depend from the ſaid Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points, that every Underſtanding Chriſtian (though he is not able to conceive the Divine Myſteries by his natural reaſon) may yet certainly and undoubtedly apprehend the doctrine or meaning of the Scripture, or the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence of it. Therefore although any Controverſie ſhould be raiſed and moved about theſe Fundamental Articles, which in the Primitive Church had not been ſufficiently declared or unanimouſly taught; yet they could not be generally neceſſary unto ſalvation for all Chriſtians, but onely their unanimous and undoubted meaning.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, beſides that what directly in it ſelf is neceſſary, there are yet

                  <p>Likewiſe, that in the laſt times the great Antichriſt ſhall come, That at Chriſts coming to judge the world, not all men ſhall die, but the reſt be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which though it is not abſolutely neceſſary unto ſalvation to know, yet it is neceſſary for him to believe it, who hath ſuch knowledge of it from the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the holy Scriptures do promiſe everlaſting life and ſalvation to all them which truely believe in Jeſus Chriſt, as he is revealed and manifeſted in them; we thereby further argue and conclude thus: That ſuch doctrine of the Scripture is <hi>not onely neceſſary,</hi> but alſo wholly <hi>ſufficient unto ſalvation;</hi> ſo that no other ſingular doctrine beſides the holy Scripture, is neceſſary unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Which alſo the Primitive Church, both in its doctrine and univerſal practice, doth abundantly teſtifie that they held the ſacred Scripture to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory unto ſalvation, even for the moſt-able and beſt-learned men, and the Five aforeſaid Symbols or Fundamental Articles ſufficient for all Unlearned Ignorant Chriſtians, as we could prove it by many evident teſtimonies of the Ancient Fathers; which having heretofore already been done by many others, we thought it ſuperfluous to enlarge our ſelves therein at this preſent.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Whether and how far the Tradition and Doctrine of the Church is neceſſary.</note>Yet next and beſides the Scripture, we do not decline and reject the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Doctrine of the Church,</hi> not as the principal <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>rule</hi> of our Faith (for that is meerly and ſolely grounded upon this, <hi>Becauſe the Lord ſaid it;</hi> but not upon this, <hi>Becauſe the Church or their teachers ſaid it</hi>) but as requiſite <hi>means</hi> whereby the Word of God is preached and taught unto us, and as a <hi>testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of that what is declared therein.</p>
                  <p>Wherein notwithſtanding we muſt exactly diſtinguiſh betwixt that, what <hi>the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Christian Church</hi> hath with an unanimous Conſent taught and believed out of the Word of God <hi>at all times,</hi> eſpecially <hi>in the Primitive times,</hi> and that what perhaps but one or other <hi>Particular Church,</hi> hath taught <hi>in the later times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatſoever the whole Chriſtian Church, eſpecially in the firſt hundred yeers immediately after the Apoſtles, hath unanimouſly taught and believed out of the Word of God as neceſſary unto ſalvation; that ſame is an Infallible <hi>mark
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:164278:12"/> and testimony</hi> that it is certainly and undoubtedly <hi>the true ſenſe and meaning of the Word of God,</hi> and conſequently is neceſſary for all Chriſtians to believe and receive it: Becauſe there is no doubt but the true Primitive Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the holy Scripture, hath received alſo from Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles the true ſenſe and meaning thereof, at leaſt in all neceſſary Fundamental Points of the Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwiſe, whatſoever <hi>the Primitive Church</hi> hath not taught, that ſame is an evident ſigne and teſtimony that it is not ſo expreſly ſet down in the holy Scripture, that all Chriſtians of neceſſitie ſhould know and believe it unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe many thouſands of the Primitive and beſt Chriſtians have been ſaved without ſuch doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>this teſtimony of the Primitive Church,</hi> of whatſoever it hath taught or not taught, is of ſuch a nature that it is not to be underſtood <hi>by all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> but onely by thoſe who are well verſed and have read the Volumes of the Ancient Fathers; which even very few of the Teachers and Miniſters are able to do. Wherefore the greater part of Chriſtians, eſpecially when the doctrine and meaning of the Primitive Church is drawn into Controverſie, ought to fix themſelves and adhere cloſely to the evident teſtimony of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, without which they cannot have any certain ground of their faith and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>For whatſoever not the Univerſal onely, but one or ſome <hi>Particular Churches</hi> have believed and taught, eſpecially in the <hi>later times,</hi> whether it were done in their <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Synods,</hi> or elſe by their publike <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> or other writings, doctrines and witneſſes: that very ſame, though it is a teſtimony of the belief and doctrine of the particular Churches; yet it cannot oblige other Churches or generally all Chriſtians, nor be neceſſary for all unto ſalvation, neither ground and confirm their faith any further then the certain and indubitable Word of God hath demonſtrated unto them, and they themſelves have received it as <hi>conſonant and agreeable</hi> to Scripture: Since it is granted on all ſides, that the particular Churches may erre in their own particular opinions, and that the Chriſtian Faith muſt not be grounded upon the word of one particular Church, but meerly and onely upon the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe the Word and Authority of the particular Churches doth binde at leaſt their <hi>fellow-members</hi> thus far, that they ought not raſhly <hi>to contradict</hi> their doctrine and declarations, unleſſe it be contradicted by a more evident teſtimony of Gods Word, and by an Unanimous doctrine of the Primitive Church.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:164278:13"/> to whom peradventure God may ſhew mercy. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe none can obtain a true knowledge and faith in Chriſt, but he muſt ſomewhat ſtrive and labour for it, that he may encreaſe and thrive therein. Like as we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and ſet a certain meaſure to the height and bigneſſe of a young childe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yet it muſt needs daily grow, if it be alive and in health) till it hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his full and perfect age: ſo may we neither circumſcribe and limit any Chriſtians knowledge within a certain meaſure, becauſe he ought to grow and augment ſtill in the knowledge, faith and doctrine of Chriſt, if he be a true Chriſtian, till he is come to a perfect man of ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe we cannot fail ſooner in any thing then when we preſume to regulate and meaſure all other mens capacities by the meaſure of our own underſtanding, and do imagine that what peradventure we think to be clear and evident in the Word of God, that very ſame muſt likewiſe be as clear to all others, and therefore as certain and neceſſary for all; which is alſo the chief and principal reaſon of all Unſeaſonable judging in matter of faith, yea, the ſource and fountain of all diviſions and diſſentions in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore it is ſufficient for our purpoſe to know in general, which no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian can deny, <hi>That all and onely that is neceſſary unto ſalvation, what neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongeth to the ſaving Faith in Christ, which worketh by love, and cannot ſubſiſt without true repentance and converſion from ſin, and without new obedience to Chriſt Commandments: Which all is ſo plainly and expreſly taught in the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Word of God, eſpecially in the Five aforementioned principal Points, that every Chriſtian may ſufficiently underſtand them unto his ſalvation, and hath been unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly profeſſed in the Primitive Apoſtolike Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatſoever is not ſo clearly and expreſly taught in the Word of God, as a neceſſary Article of Faith, Love and Obedience towards Chriſt, nor hath been underſtood and taught out of the ſame in the Primitive Church: That very ſame, though it dependeth from it by a neceſſary conſequence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be true doctrine and agreeable to Scripture: yet it cannot be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them, who do not underſtand it as yet, and <hi>retain onely the Fundamental doctrine it ſelf, the ſaving faith and love towards Chriſt:</hi> at leaſt ſo long till God enlighteneth and bringeth their underſtanding to a fuller knowledge of the Truth, which they in the fear of God ought daily to ſearch into.</p>
                  <p>Whereby we do conclude further, that <hi>We ought alſo not to judge one another</hi> (according to the aforeſaid rule of the Apoſtle) in theſe doctrines. Eſpecially when the other may produce <hi>Motives and reaſons to the contrary,</hi> and ſuch, which are taken not <hi>from natural reaſon,</hi> but <hi>from the Word of God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bindeth not onely <hi>his underſtanding,</hi> but alſo <hi>his conſcience,</hi> that he cannot receive ſuch doctrines for fear of ſinning againſt God and his Word, but muſt at leaſt doubt of them. For in ſuch a caſe we muſt ſay, <hi>Whoſoever doubteth, if he eateth</hi> (if he receiveth them) <hi>is damned</hi> (by his own conſcience.) And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the Apoſtle's exhortation, in ſuch controverſies of doctrines, <hi>We must receive him that is weak in faith, but not to doubtful diſputations. Who art thou that judgest another mans ſervant? To his own maſter he ſtandeth or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

                     <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholike Church hath no ground to Judge and condemn the Protestant Reformed Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Churches as Heretical.</head>
                  <p>HAving laid this ground, we may eaſily, and as much as is neceſſary for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones conſcience unto ſalvation, deliver our Judgement and Opinion concerning the Modern differences and diſſentions in matters of Religion, which among the Chriſtians that make on all ſides profeſſion of the written Word of God contained in the Old and New Teſtament, are fomented and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated meerly out of an Unſeaſonable and Uncharitable judging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning with ſuch vehemency and bitterneſſe, yea, with ſuch great effuſion of blood and lamentable devaſtation of Countreys, that never the like was heard of any other Religion in the world.</p>
                  <p>At this preſent I will make but a ſhort Application to the Three principal divided and diſſenting Churches,<note place="margin">Differences betwixt the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> which are diſperſed in the <hi>Occidental Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World</hi> thorowout whole Provinces and Kingdoms. As firſt, the ſaid <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholikes,</hi> or <hi>Papists</hi> ſo called, who beſides the holy Scriptures, are grounded upon <hi>the traditions of the Church,</hi> and eſpecially upon the <hi>Councel of Trent,</hi> and generally are altogether ſubjected and depend on <hi>the Pope of Rome,</hi> as being their Supreme Head and Judge in matters of Religion and Conſcience; as the Churches in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and the greater part in <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, <hi>the Protestant Evangelical Lutherans,</hi> as they themſelves will be called; who beſides the holy Scripture, profeſſe <hi>Confeſſionem Agustanam &amp; Saxonicam formulam Concordiae</hi> as their Symbolical and Univerſal Books of doctrine; not that they <hi>ground</hi> principally their Faith and Religion upon them, but that they hold the doctrine and opinions of them <hi>conformable to Scripture</hi> and <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto Salvation;</hi> as in <hi>Germany,</hi> eſpecially in high and lowe <hi>Saxony,</hi> ſome Churches in <hi>Swaben, Francony, Weſtphaly, Heſſen,</hi> &amp;c. and without <hi>Germany,</hi> the Churches in <hi>Denmark, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> although there is ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference perceived betwixt them; becauſe ſome have not received hitherto as yet the ſaid <hi>formulam Saxonicam,</hi> and ſome of them have collected their own peculiar <hi>Corpora doctrinae,</hi> Confeſſions and Books of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, thoſe <hi>Evangelical Chriſtian Protestants,</hi> who, becauſe they will not be bound and tied to any man's, whether it be <hi>Luther</hi>'s, <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, <hi>Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> or any other's Doctrine or Books, and therefore not be named by any man's name; but have purged and reformed their Doctrine and Religion from the abuſes of Popery, onely according to the written Word of God, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Reformed</hi> (by ſome Papiſts they are called <hi>Biblists</hi> or <hi>Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> of which name they need not to be aſhamed, becauſe they are grounded
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:164278:14"/> on and refer themſelves wholly to the holy Bible) as the Churches in <hi>England, Scotland, Helvetia,</hi> the United Provinces of the Low-Countreys, all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in <hi>France,</hi> with ſome particular Churches in <hi>Germany, Poland, Hungary,</hi> &amp;c. Which though they have collected and framed alſo their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Confeſſions, yet not with the intent to binde other Chriſtians conſciences even to their word, but onely to teſtifie their Unanimous conſent and Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie firſt and principally in the neceſſary fundamental Points of ſalvation, out of the manifeſt Word of God; then ſecondarily, in the confutation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of the erroneous By-doctrines, eſpecially thoſe of the Popiſh Churches, which have no ground in the Word of God, but are <hi>è diametro</hi> oppoſite to it by a neceſſary conſequence, And withal to decline and refute all ſorts of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſlanders of their Adverſaries. Wherefore alſo they by a ſpecial Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs, do not reject the Confeſſion of others, eſpecially that of <hi>Augſpourg,</hi> though there be ſome difference in words remaining, much leſſe do preſume to condemn other Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches becauſe of ſome different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Ceremonies, if onely they do agree with them in the fundamental points of doctrine, and for the reſt, withhold themſelves from condemning others.</p>
                  <p>And even for theſe very ſame reaſons have I hitherto addicted my ſelf to the Confeſſion of theſe Reformed Churches, and am reſolved with Gods aſſiſtance, to perſevere in it even unto death, not onely becauſe I acknowledge in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Points, the doctrine of theſe Churches (I ſay, <hi>Their own doctrine, which they themſelves <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nanimouſly profeſſe</hi>) to be conſonant and agreeable to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: but eſpecially becauſe beſides the Indubitable Univerſal, Fundamental Doctrines and neceſſary Articles of faith, which they with one conſent receive, they do not maintain or impoſe upon others any other doctrine as neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, which in it ſelf and by Gods command is not; but impart and permit to every one <hi>the due libertie of Conſcience,</hi> and alſo do neither deny, pervert or mutilate any part or articles of the true Goſpel of Chriſt, nor intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any other By-Goſpel or By-articles, or judge or condemn others for it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas other Churches, principally the Papiſts and partly the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> if they do not quite <hi>deny</hi> any neceſſary point of true Chriſtianitie; yet do very much tranſgreſſe the true limits and rules both of Gods truth and Chriſtian Charitie, ſeeing they <hi>Adde</hi> many of their Doctrines and impoſe them upon others, as neceſſary unto ſalvation, or judge and condemn them therein as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which nevertheleſſe in themſelves and by Gods command are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yea, falſe and not agreeable to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I do not deny but there be ſome ſuch ſort of people found in our Churches, which are too too zealous and obſtinate in their own opinions, and undertake to judge others, who will not altogether give their aſſent to them: Which is not ſutable to the unanimous Doctrine of our Churches, and therefore may not be imputed to the whole Univerſal Church.</p>
                  <p>But that we may well know, which of theſe three divided and diſſenting Churches judgeth the other, or is judged by them aright or wrong; I will firſt declare but briefly and onely as much as may conduce to the information of the Unlearned; <hi>Whether the other two, the Romane Catholikes and the Lutherans,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:164278:14"/> have any ſufficient and well-grounded reaſon to judge and condemn our Reformed Churches as Heretical.</hi> Then ſhall I take an opportunitie to ſhew in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part of this Apoſtolical Direction, <hi>Whether and how far our Churches ought to judge and condemn the other Two, the Papiſts and the Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Romiſh Church hath no ſufficient ground to judge and condemn our Reformed or Lutherane Churches, as far as they agree with us, to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; we make it good by reaſoning thus: Becauſe they cannot accuſe us or make us believe, <hi>that our Churches either deny any Article of the Ancient, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike Catholike Faith, or do introduce and condeſcend to any falſe heretical Point:</hi> But they do condemn us meerly for this, becauſe <hi>we do not receive ſome articles of their Modern Doctrine and Religion, which they cry up for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal or Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and yet either are <hi>not neceſſary unto ſalvation,</hi> as they muſt confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the greater part of them, or <hi>falſe, erroneous and ſuperſtitious,</hi> as we are convinced by the Word of God in our own Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, although they charge and accuſe us of all ſorts of new,<note place="margin">Calumnies and ſlanders of the Papiſts againſt the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proteſtants.</note> Un-catholike, falſe, and partly heretical, damnable, blaſphemous Doctrines; As that we make God to be the Author of ſin: That we do deny all free-will of man, even after his regeneration: That according to our Doctrine it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, even to the believers, to keep the commandments of our Saviour: That by Faith onely we may be ſaved and juſtified, though we live never ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: That all ſins ſhall be forgiven us, if we do but believe that they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, though we do ſtill continue in them: That the Juſtification is wrought meerly by an external imputation, without internal renovation and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That Repentance, and confeſſion of ſins, and new obedience, and good works, are quite unneceſſary: That we reject all Faſting, all Vows, and Church-diſcipline, Dignities, Orders and Traditions of the Church; yea, obedience to Magiſtrates: Annihilate the Sacraments, or hold them to be but naked bare Signes: Blaſpheme and deſpiſe the Saints in heaven; and ſuch-like Points: Againſt which our Churches have always ſolemnly proteſted, both in their Confeſſions and Apologies, that ſuch was not their faith and opinion, but that all theſe are but meer ſlanders, detractions, and miſ-conſtructions. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have declared themſelves with one accord, that they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nor hearken <hi>to any new doctrine,</hi> but onely adhere cloſely <hi>to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctrine of the primitive Apostolike Church,</hi> as it is principally grounded upon the ſacred Scripture, being the main rule of our Faith, and as it hath been declared out of the Word of God, againſt all Sects and Hereſies, with an Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent of the Primitive Church, eſpecially in the General Chriſtian Synods of <hi>Nicene, Epheſus, Chalcedone</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Univerſal confeſſion of Faith they unanimouſly maintain, of which the Romiſh Church it ſelf confeſſeth in the laſt Council of <hi>Trent, Concil. Trid. ſeſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>to be the buckler and ſhield againſt all Hereſies, the Principle whereunto neceſſarily he must agree that will profeſſe the Christian Faith; yea, the ſolid and ſole foundation, against which the gates of hell ſhall not prevail.</hi> Wherefore our Churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly be charged with any new heretical doctrine, becauſe, though one of our Divines ſhould defend any new opinion or expoſition of the Scripture, yet they do not binde themſelves to it, much leſſe enforce it upon others as neceſſary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:164278:15"/> unto ſalvation, but give way to be examined according to the rule and ſquare of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>When now for all this, the Romane Catholikes perſiſt to condemn our Churches as heretical, becauſe we will not receive beſides ſuch Ancient true Catholike Chriſtian Faith, all their modern new-fangled Doctrines and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they have ſince added and invented in their Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and other Popiſh Councils of late times, or in the Decrees of the Popes: It behoveth them firſt to prove and ſhew firm and certain grounds, that thoſe Doctrines of theirs are grounded upon the holy Scripture and the Primitive Church, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Principal Controverſies betwixt the Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes and Evangelical Proteſtants.</note>For Example: Will they condemn us in our exteriour Service, or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Ceremonies, becauſe we have no Images of the holy and bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, of our Saviour, of the Saints deceaſed, nor do adore them: That we do not pray and call on the holy Angels and the ſouls of the Saints in heaven, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> yea, that we do not digg and take their bones or other reliques out of their graves and worſhip them, nor pay Vows or make Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to them: That we do not buy or purchaſe the Popes Indulgencies, celebrate no Maſſes for the ſouls of the dead, nor make any diſtinction of meats on certain days, or a general weekly Faſt; neither admit of any Auricular confeſſion to the Prieſt of every particular ſin: That we do not adminiſter the holy Communion under one but both kindes or elements of Bread and Wine both to Lay and Clergie-men; nor celebrate any Maſſes without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, neither make uſe of the reſt of Ceremonies, which they, againſt the firſt Inſtitution of Chriſt, have forged for their Sacrifice of Maſſe, eſpecially the adoration of the conſecrated <hi>hoſtia</hi> in the holy Sacrament: That we do not obſerve their great Feaſt, called <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi>-day, and the holy days of the Saints: That we perform our whole Publike Service not in the Latine Tongue, which is unknown to the Laicks, but in the known Mother-tongue, nor forbid to any Lay-man the reading of the holy Bible in his Mother-tongue, but exhort rather every one in general unto it: That we tell not our Prayers to God on Beads by fifties and hundreds; uſe not the ſprinkling of the holy water, nor wear about us <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> or ſuch like conſecrated reliques: That we allow not of the Orders of Monks and Nunnes, but in ſtead thereof we teach that the revenues of Monaſteries ought rather to be converted to the uſe of miſerable poor wretches that are not able to work, or employed for the maintenance of Churches and Schools: That we give liberty for Marriage both to Eccleſiaſticks and Laicks, nor uſe the Confirmation and Extreme unction, or the holy Orders for making Miniſters in ſuch a manner as it uſually is amongſt them: That we permit no Temporal Juriſdiction or Dominion to our Spiritual Paſtors, nor will have them ſubmit to a Supreme and Univerſal Pope; neither exempt them from the juriſdiction and judicature of civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; and ſuch like obſervations and aſſertions of their exteriour Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Will they therefore, I ſay, judge and condemn us as hereticks? it is fit then to prove firſt by certain and undeniable Arguments and Warrants, and ſuch which we may underſtand and ſatisfie our conſciences withal, that the ſaid Points are neceſſary to the ſaving Faith and Obedience of Chriſt; Except
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:164278:15"/> they would yeeld and confeſſe that they do condemn us for unneceſſary things.</p>
                  <p>But now the Papiſts themſelves will hardly affirm the aforeſaid Points, the Images, the Invocation of the Saints, the Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be directly and in themſelves neceſſary unto ſalvation; They commend and extol onely their ſingular good uſe and benefit, but do not enjoyn their neceſſity: Or in caſe they would in one or other point, as in the Auricular confeſſion, Adoration of the conſecrated <hi>Hostia,</hi> &amp;c. intrude a neceſſity; yet they cannot make it appear ſo upon any pretence nor ground: But we may have evident proofs from the Word of God to the contrary, that they are not neceſſary, becauſe they were not uſed by the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in Points of Controverſies, and articles of Faith and Doctrine; That we have the affiance and aſſurance to be juſtified and ſaved before God, not through our own merits and ſatisfaction, but onely through meer mercy and grace by a true and lively faith in the onely perfect Sacrifice of propitiation and merits of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: That alſo in the whole work of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and ſalvation, we aſcribe nothing at all to our own natural ſtrength of free-will, but all to the meer grace and aſſiſtance of God, without which we are able to do nothing that is good; how can they then condemn us as hereticks for it, whereas they muſt at length confeſſe themſelves,<note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Juſtificat. cap. <hi>7.</hi> Propoſ. <hi>2</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> this to be the ſafeſt and ſureſt way not to confide and truſt in our own ſtrength, works, merits, but onely in Gods meer grace and mercy, and the precious merits of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt? If this be the ſureſt way, we muſt certainly and neceſſarily conclude, that our Doctrine in this point is not heretical, nor dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and their Doctrine of own merits and ſtrength not neceſſary unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but rather, that our Doctrine is the ſureſt and ſafeſt, whereby all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe is denied to man, and attributed to God alone, and their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine dangerous and pernicious, aſcribing all honour to man, and denying it to God.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that we cannot be induced to believe the transformation of the bread, or Tranſubſtantiation (as they call it) in the Supper of the Lord, or a true Sacrifice, though without blood, of the tranſubſtantiated Body and Blood of Chriſt both for the quick and the dead, or the Purgatory. They cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for, unleſſe they do convince us firſt, that ſuch Doctrines are neceſſary unto ſalvation: ſo that Chriſts Sacrifice upon the Croſſe, and the Spiritual eating thereof, profiteth us nothing, and the Blood of Chriſt cannot cleanſe us from ſins, except we believe alſo the Sacrifice of Maſſe and the Purgatory; which nevertheleſſe, I hope, they will not aſſert, or never be able to prove, ſince they partly confeſſe themſelves, that they could not have been aſſured in thoſe and ſuch like points, onely by the words of our Lord Jeſus, unleſſe the declaration and determination of the Church had given to them ſatisfaction therein.</p>
                  <p>And this is their main Objection,<note place="margin">Whether ſuch Points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, though not neceſſary in themſelves, are yet neceſſary for all Chriſtians by reaſon of the determination of the Church.</note> That the afore-mentioned and ſuch like Controverſies of their Doctrine and Religion, though they be not directly and in themſelves neceſſary unto ſalvation, yet are neceſſary even for this reaſon,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:164278:16"/> Becauſe they have been thus taught and ordained by the Catholike Church, which ought to be believed and obeyed in all things.</p>
                  <p>But here we ask firſt the queſtion, What they mean <hi>by the Catholike Church?</hi> If they underſtand the Univerſal Chriſtian Church, which ſince the Apoſtles hath been at all times and in all places diſperſed (as the word <hi>Catholike</hi> doth imply it) then we confeſſe, as we have already declared it heretofore, that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it teacheth <hi>with one accord as neceſſary unto ſalvation,</hi> to be undoubtedly neceſſary: But they themſelves will not aſſert this of moſt of the aforeſaid Points; and though they ſhould aſſert it of ſome, yet can they not prove it neither from the Word of God, nor by the true and undoubted Writings of the Ancient Fathers: Whereas by this very ſame ground, we can rather make appear the contrary, that the moſt and principal points thereof muſt be either falſe and erroneous, or at leaſt unneceſſary, becauſe they have not been taught thus in the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Neither hath the Primitive Church ever preſumed and taken upon it ſelf ſuch a power, as if it might or ſhould teach or ordain ſome new Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, and ſo impoſe on the Chriſtians a heavier yoke, and preſcribe them a narrower way to ſalvation then it hath received from Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>Whereby alſo conſequently is made void, whatſoever they object concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwritten Word of God,</hi> being not able to produce any certain ground or warrant, that it was received by the Primitive Church. Although other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we do not abſolutely reject the Traditions of the Church, which either are grounded upon the Scripture, or are counted onely as Uſeful Ordinances of the Church, and not as neceſſary unto ſalvation.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:164278:17"/> Pope with his Prelates teacheth and ordaineth, muſt therefore be neceſſary to ſalvation; and even in thoſe things, whereof they confeſſe themſelves, that God hath not commanded them in his Word, neither have been taught or ordained thus in the Primitive Apoſtolike Church.</p>
                  <p>Whereas we may rather demonſtrate, that God hath plainly ordained the contrary in his Word, that we ſhould not adore and worſhip the Images, that we ſhould not call upon the Creatures, that we all that eat of the Bread of the Lord, ſhall drink alſo of the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſhall we be obliged to believe and obey the Doctrine and Tradition of this Church, to the hazard and danger of our ſalvation? And that onely upon its bare word, becauſe it boaſteth <hi>that it cannot erre,</hi> and that it applieth every thing to it ſelf, which is ſpoken of the Catholike Church or of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the Scripture? Pray, what is this elſe but to exalt the Church, or the Pope under the name of the Church, above God and his Word? May we not rather ſay to them with <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 4.19. <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you more then unto God, judge ye?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath exempted us from the neceſſitie of the Moſaical Ceremonial Law, how much more then from ſuch humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which under the name of <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſors or of the Church, are urged as a neceſſary Point of the Chriſtian Religion, either without any warrant from Gods Word, or againſt it?</p>
                  <p>By all which I hope it doth ſufficiently appear, that the chief controverſies betwixt the Romane Catholike and our Churches, concern not any <hi>new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> which we have introduced on our ſide, nether <hi>the true Primitive Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike doctrine</hi> which ſince Chriſt and the Apoſtles hath been profeſſed with one accord of the Primitive Church (for this very ſame we are ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive in every point, yea, we have received it already, and wiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more but that the Romiſh Church might adhere cloſely to it without any addition.) But that the whole diſpute and difference is meerly concerning ſuch Doctrines and Traditions of the Modern Romane Church, whereof the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church ſince the Apoſtles times in the firſt Three and Four hundred yeers and more, either knew nothing at all, or hath taught and practiſed the contrary: or though it hath made uſe of ſome ſuch ceremonies and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet held them no ways for neceſſary Points of the Chriſtian Religion unto ſalvation, but onely as free exerciſes of devotion, which afterwards neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe have been converted into maifold abuſes againſt their firſt intention, as we could punctually explain it, and many of our Divines have already abundantly and often ſpent their ſtudie and labour in it.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we refer to the ſerious conſideration of all Chriſtian and pious hearts, Whether men have cauſe and ground to judge and condemn us as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. We for our part are aſſured, that what hath not been for the firſt Chriſtians neceſſary unto ſalvation, in ſo many hundred yeers, without which ſo many thouſand Martyrs, and ſo many millions of Chriſtians are piouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of this life; that cannot be alſo neceſſary for us in theſe laſt times, and we may live and die as religious Chriſtians without it.

                  <p>But, we hope that all underſtanding and conſcientious men, and ſuch as love Truth and Peace amongſt the Romane Catholikes, will beware of this maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and taking ſeriouſly to heart this Declaration of ours, abſtain hereafter from preſumptuous judging and condemning us as Hereticks, much leſſe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute us with Fire and Sword, and Loſſes of our Goods and Honours, as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have done: which certainly doth not proceed from the Spirit of Chriſt, but undoubtedly from the Devil, who is that Arch-lyer and Murderer.

                  <p>Although we for our part do not account them abſolutely indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but in ſome regard neceſſary, partly becauſe of Gods command, partly becauſe of the example of Chriſt, the Apoſtles and the Primitive Apoſtolical Church; At leaſt for our ſelves, who ſhould ſin, if we ſhould againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences uſe the Exorciſm or the Images, or without any urgent cauſe omit the breaking of the bread: Yet, ſince we judge not, nor condemn according to the above-mentioned Apoſtolical Rule, thoſe that do not judge the breaking of the bread neceſſary, but give way to their pretended liberty; It were fit they alſo ſhould not condemn us therein, but to impart to us ſo much freedom, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:164278:18"/> we may herein follow the example of Chriſt (which we may do more ſafely, and without any ſin) as we likewiſe permit them to omit it, and in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to follow the example of the Papiſts.</p>
                  <p>In like manner that we in our Catechiſm punctually retain all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments as they are ſet down <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5, and do not omit,<note place="margin">2. In the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> as they do, <hi>the Second Commandment concerning Images;</hi> will they judge us therefore? Should we not have the liberty to teach and to learn the Commandments of God, as God himſelf hath ſpoken them from heaven, and with his own finger graved them in the Two Tables of ſtone? Whereas we tolerate the Omiſſion of the Commandment of Images in them that hold it not abſolutely neceſſary for Children and Ignorants, though we cannot approve thereof nor excuſe it, eſpecially ſeeing what great Idolatry it hath bred in Popery, and that the ſaid Commandment doth extend as well to the Children and Idiots, as to the Prieſts and Levites; yea, we conceive it to be moſt neceſſary for thoſe, being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bent to Images and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in the differences in <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> that in <hi>the holy Communion</hi> by eating Sacramentally the bleſſed bread and wine, we believe onely a <hi>Spiritual partaking</hi> or <hi>communion</hi> and <hi>preſence</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and not <hi>a carnal</hi> and <hi>corporal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither believe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity</hi> or <hi>Omnipreſence</hi> of Chriſts Body, but the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent power, vertue and raigning</hi> of Chriſt true God and Man, even in thoſe places where his Body is not preſent.</p>
                  <p>Nor an <hi>

                  <p>Will they for theſe or other ſuch like points of Controverſie in Doctrine for the moſt part ariſing from thence, judge and condemn us as Hereticks (as moſt of them uſe to do?) then they muſt firſt prove, that their opinions and manner of expreſſions in thoſe points which they ſo fiercely inſiſt upon, and whereon commonly all the controverſie dependeth, are not onely agreeable to Truth, but alſo abſolutely neceſſary unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall ſooner prove thoſe not to be <hi>warrantable</hi> by Scripture, then they ſhall make them good to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſeeing we cannot finde any wherein the Word of God <hi>the truth,</hi> much leſſe <hi>the neceſſity</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:164278:19"/>
                  <p>For what is then that is neceſſary unto ſalvation? We agree already both in this againſt the Papiſts; namely, that whatſoever is neceſſary unto ſalvation, is plainly and expreſly taught in the holy Scripture; but whatſoever are onely bare words of men, and Humane Traditions and Doctrines, ought and muſt not be neceſſary unto ſalvation, though otherwiſe they are not repugnant to truth. Wherefore they muſt firſt prove that ſuch opinions and manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of theirs which they eſteem to be neceſſary, are expreſly taught in the Scripture; and yet ſo, that we alſo may certainly and undoubtedly conceive them to be grounded thereon, as a neceſſary point of ſaving Faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>They will ſay, That they have proved it already ſufficiently and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not by words of the Scripture it ſelf, at leaſt by equivalent words, and by a neceſſary conſequence drawn out of them; And that we therefore onely will not receive and condeſcend unto it, becauſe it is contrary and repugnant to our natural reaſon: As for Example; When the Lord ſpeaketh of the Bread, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body,</hi> they make it to be equivalent, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Eat my Body in and with the bread,</hi> and that he meant a natural, corporal and carnal eating. Likewiſe when the Lord ſaid, <hi>I am with you till to the end of the world,</hi> they infer that his Body alſo is preſent with us, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt, or his Godhead, is nowhere without his Body, or ſeparated from it.</p>
                  <p>But although this may ſeem to them in their Reaſon to be a clear and plain Expoſition, or a neceſſary Conſequence; yet we examining and comparing not onely our Reaſon, but alſo the words of Chriſt himſelf, and not the Five words by themſelves alone, but all the words of the whole Inſtitution toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, of the whole Scripture; we finde the Contrary a great deal clearer and plainer, that the words of Chriſt are not agreeable to their Interpretation, nor their Conſequence of any validity, much leſſe of neceſſity. For indeed this is plain and manifeſt, that Chriſt ſaying to his diſciples, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> ſpoke of the bread which he took, brake and gave to them, and that he meant there a corporal, carnal, viſible and natural eating of the bread; And it is alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and evident that he ſpoke of that bread: <hi>This</hi> (which I have broken and given) <hi>This bread</hi> (which ye take and eat) <hi>This is my Body which ſhall be given for you:</hi> But that this is to be underſtood <hi>after a carnal and corporal manner,</hi> ſo that his body who ſate with them at Table, and reached to them the bread, hath been Inviſibly in and under the bread, and eaten, though ſupernaturally, with their carnal mouth, is no ways clear and manifeſt: But they themſelves, and the Papiſts alſo, notwithſtanding they adhere and inſiſt both upon <hi>the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe;</hi> yet they cannot agree among themſelves in their pretended literal meaning; and beſides, they both muſt confeſſe that they are <hi>words of</hi> peculiar <hi>Myſteries,</hi> which ought to be Myſtically and Sacramentally underſtood. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is yet more clear and manifeſt, ſince <hi>Spiritual things must be compared with Spiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.13, that theſe words alſo, after the na ure and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of other Sacraments, muſt have a Spiritual meaning, as the Lord himſelf ſaith of the eating of his Body and the drinking of his Blood: <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Spirit, and they are Life,</hi> Joh. 6 63. As both Papiſts and Lutherans muſt acknowledge, that in the Lords Supper is principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:164278:19"/> a <hi>Spiritual eating.</hi> We have alſo many pregnant motives, which are not onely grounded upon Natural Reaſon, but upon the words of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, upon the undoubted Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and upon many other manifeſt places of the Scripture, and therefore binde not onely <hi>our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> but <hi>our Conſciences,</hi> that we cannot receive by any means their Interpretation concerning the Inviſible body in the bread and the carnal eating thereof (which may be common both to the unbelieving and ungodly Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and alſo to the believing) becauſe it doth more evidently appear to be repugnant to theſe words of God, then to be extracted out of the ſame by conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But if we deſire to have a certain, undoubted, and neceſſary Expoſition of theſe words, Chriſt himſelf and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath declared it unto us: That the breaſt and wine is called the Body and Blood of Chriſt, becauſe it is <hi>the New Testament and the Communion of his Body and Blood,</hi> and becauſe we <hi>ought to eat and drink it in remembrance of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we deſire alſo to know how we ought worthily to eat and drink the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt; Chriſt himſelf hath taught it ſo plainly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6, that our Adverſaries themſelves muſt confeſſe, that not onely the afore-mentioned Spiritual eating of the Lords Supper is principally required, but alſo is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true and ſaving eating, without which the oral manducation is rather noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then profitable and wholeſome.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we hold this declaration of Chriſt ſufficient unto Salvation; and him that onely ſtandeth to it, or giveth us but libertie to ſtand to it, we will in like manner not compel neceſſarily to receive our interpretations and expreſſions, which we acknowledge to be conformable to the words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Chriſt: much leſſe will we judge or condemn any man for an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, becauſe of the verbal alterations and diſceptations in Schools; whether what Figure or <hi>Tropus, Metonymia,</hi> or <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> or <hi>praedicatio inuſitata</hi> it may be called.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe it is clear and manifeſt, that Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us and all Believers, as true God and Man, with his aſſiſtance and grace, Spirit and gifts, power and operation, which no Chriſtian can deny. But to infer and conclude thereby, that alſo his body, fleſh and bones muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be preſent with us &amp; all creatures on earth; That is no ways plain and evident, ſo that ſome of their own Divines do contradict it themſelves by other manifeſt and plain teſtimonies of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may we ſay of all other different Points of Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and them; and alſo of the Controverſie of Predeſtination and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and what doth depend on it, wherein we next to the holy Scripture not onely refer our ſelves to <hi>Auguſtine, Prosper, Fulgentius</hi> and other Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and withal to the principal Scholaſtick Authors and Divines among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, <hi>Thomas, Scotus</hi> and others that followed them, eſpecially to the Modern Dominicans; but alſo to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Which is the chief and principal Question in this preſent Difference of Religion, and what are the ſafest means for the ſettlement of a Christian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</head>
                  <p>COnſiderirg exactly every thing that hitherto hath been declared, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently manifeſt thereby, that all differences in matter of Religion that now adays are in agitation betwixt the ſaid Chriſtians, eſpecially betwixt thoſe who acknowledge the holy Scripture to be the onely perfect Rule of their Faith and Religion, meerly reſide in this chief and cardinal queſtion, which if it were rightly and unanimouſly anſwered on all ſides, no doubt, all ſuch Contention and Controverſie, or all uncharitable Judging and Condemning, would fall of it ſelf, and a happie Unitie might be ſetled among all Chriſtians in Doctrine and Religion, as much as may be neceſſary unto their ſalvation: Namely, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſides the holy Scripture it ſelf, ſuch Interpretations and Conſequences or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences (which by ſome Teachers or Particular Churches that follow them, are colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and deduced out of the Word of God, according to the underſtanding they have, for their part in the Scripture, and held and received for certain, undoubted, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary expoſitions and conſequences) although they are not ſo plain and manifest, that all other knowing and underſtanding Chriſtians beſides them may conceive them, or as the Primitive Christian Church hath unanimouſly and undoubtedly received and taught, ought yet to be abſolutely neceſſary for all men unto ſalvation, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all thoſe that do not acknowledge and receive ſuch Interpretations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as agreeable to Scripture, may therefore be judged and condemned for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which we directly anſwer, <hi>No ſuch matter.</hi> But ſupppſe that ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations or Inferences were certain and true, or in themſelves neceſſary to be received by thoſe that underſtand them; yet they are not neceſſary for thoſe that do not comprehend and conceive them as yet in their conſciences; neither can they therefore be judged as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> but ought to be received as <hi>weak in faith,</hi> according to the Apoſtles admonition: <hi>Them, that are weak in faith, receive you, but not to doubtful diſputations;</hi> not to judge their thoughts, and to diſtract their conſciences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The main cauſe of all diſſentions and differences in the Church of God.</note>I think rather, even this to be the main and principal ſource and origine of all Diviſions and Tyrannie in the Church of God, that men ſet upon their own Interpretations, Illations, Comments, Gloſſes, <hi>Formula's,</hi> Expreſſions, (which peradventure they pretend themſelves to infer out of the Word of God, according to the profunditie of their underſtanding, or elſe adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto out of Humane Traditions and Opinions) as high, nay, a higher eſtimate and price, and inſiſt as vehemently thereupon, as upon the Indubitable Word of God it ſelf: As if their words and expoſitions were as certain and neceſſary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:164278:20"/> unto ſalvation as the Word of God; yea, as if they were able in ſome points to utter and deliver more plainly, expreſly, fully, and conſiderately the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Myſteries then the holy Ghoſt hath expreſſed them in the whole Scripture; Or as if all men did ſee whatſoever they think themſelves to ſee and to know in the depth of their Underſtanding, or though they do not ſee it, yet were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe upon their word: This, this is the main and chief cauſe of all Diviſions and Diſſentions, and of all unreaſonable judging and condemning in the Univerſal Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo <hi>the true fundamental point of Popery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Point of Popery.</note> whereon all the Diſputes and Controverſies betwixt us and them depend: That the Pope with his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates pretend to be an Infallible Judge of all different and doubtful Doctrines, whoſe ſentence and deciſion all men upon pain of damnation as certainly ought to believe and obey as the Word of God it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Upon this One onely ground all Popery is built; And principally for this Point we are conſtrained to abandon it. For otherwiſe for our part we could well yeeld to him his <hi>Primatum</hi> or Supremacie above all Biſhops, yea, above Emperours and Kings (as long as it pleaſeth them) upon condition he would not preſume to take upon him <hi>Dominatum</hi> and ruling over mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and expound alſo the Word of God, the beſt he can, and propound his ſentence and opinion to his children within his Biſhoprick, or alſo to others that will believe and obey him; if he would but acknowledge withal that he, as well as others, could erre and fail in thoſe things which are not expreſly and plainly grounded upon the Word of God; or at leaſt, that it ſhould not be neceſſary unto ſalvation for us, who do not acknowledge and receive it. But when he will abſolutely have his word parallel with Gods Word, even in thoſe points which we cannot but judge to be evidently repugnant to the Word of God, and ſo in ſtead of Chriſt will be a Lord over our ſouls and conſciences, and of the Univerſal Chriſtian Church on earth: Certainly thoſe can no ways be blamed, who not onely give him no credit therein at all, but by reaſon of that proclame him to be the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince we may not grant this power to the Popes at <hi>Rome,</hi> although they had entangled by their perſwaſion and kept in ſubjection during many hundred yeers in the Weſtern Church, ſo many Emperours and Kings, yea, all Doctours, Biſhops and Prelates; how much leſſe may we impart it to any other Paſtor and Teacher of Gods Church, of what name ſoever? And he that ſhould aſcribe perhaps to <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin, Jerome, Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Abuſes of mens particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinions and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions amongſt the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</note> &amp;c. or to any particular Convocations, as to the Authors <hi>Formulae Concordiae Sax.</hi> as alſo to whole and National Synods, that their own particular Interpretations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:164278:21"/>
                  <p>For my part, I confeſſe that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> have in the principal and moſt Points (though not in all) well, truely and profitably expounded the Scripture, becauſe they have compared and declared for the moſt part Scripture by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>I acknowledge alſo that the Doctrine of the Confeſſion and Apologie of <hi>Augſpourg,</hi> with other Confeſſions of the Reformed Churches, Alſo the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Synod at <hi>Derdrecht</hi> is true and agreeable in it ſelf to Scripture, in thoſe Articles that have been handled and concluded therein; though withal I doubt not but ſome other Teachers of our Churches have yet expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better and more perſpicuouſly in ſome one or other point of the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But that we ſhould hold their declarations and particular opinions and expreſſions as indubitable and neceſſary unto ſalvation as the Word of God it ſelf, and preſently judge and condemn thoſe for Hereticks, who do not fully receive them; They themſelves, as much as I know, have never yet required it; But thoſe, who under the name of Lutherans addict themſelves to the profeſſion of the <hi>Formulae Concordiae Saxonicae,</hi> when they not onely binde and tie their Miniſters to it by a ſolemn Oath, but alſo us, who do not receive in points of Controverſies their expoſitions, expreſſions and inferences contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, for thorowly agreeable to Scripture; what is that then but to judge and condemn us as Hereticks? From whence muſt neceſſarily follow, that their expreſſions and opinions ought to be as certain, and undoubted, and as neceſſary unto ſalvation as the Word of God it ſelf, which indeed would be a plain New Popery.</p>
                  <p>They uſe to accuſe us,<note place="margin">Who are thoſe that make the natural reaſon to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and rule of their Faith.</note> that we make our <hi>Natural Reaſon the foundation and rule of our Faith:</hi> Whereas we principally inſiſt thereupon, that we ought not to ground any Article of Faith upon humane Reaſon, but meerly upon the plain, manifeſt and undoubted Word of God. We make uſe of our Reaſon, having been enlightned and brought unto the knowledge of Chriſt, as of a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite means</hi> whereby to learn to underſtand the holy Scripture; for without Reaſon it cannot be underſtood:<note place="margin">How far the Reaſon may be uſed in matters of Faith.</note> That we alſo ought to infer out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whatſoever by a neceſſary conſequence dependeth from it, and is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it, as much as we by Gods grace are able to comprehend it, or to refute and to reject whatſoever is repugnant to it: And that we ought reverently to apply the holy Scripture unto Doctrine, Conſolation and Admonition; yet ſo that we do not oblige and binde any man in his conſcience further to thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations and Inferences we in our underſtanding derive out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then himſelf together with us is able to underſtand them to be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by it, and the Word of God doth binde thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe who cry up their own Interpretations, Inferences and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not onely for True Doctrines, but even for Neceſſary Articles of Faith, inſomuch that they judge and condemn as Hereticks all others that do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be agreeable to Scripture; They are thoſe who make their Own reaſon and underſtanding to be the foundation and rule of their Faith; and yet not onely of their own, but of other mens Faith, and of the Univerſal Chriſtian Church; They are thoſe who make themſelves new Popes and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:164278:21"/> Infallible Judges in matters of Religion and Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Which honour we cannot give to any man living on earth, but to God alone and his undeniable Word contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as alſo all the Proteſtant Churches in whole <hi>Europe</hi> have Unanimouſly always againſt Popery referred themſelves thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe we do not reject <hi>all conſequences and interpretations,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How far we may make uſe of Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations in matters of Faith.</note> nor <hi>all mens expreſſions,</hi> though they are not verbally and literally ſet down in the Scripture; as alſo we do not diſapprove the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the Scripture into other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. We rather confeſſe that many Inferences and Interpretations may be very good, profitable, ſound and neceſſary in themſelves, and that we may many times of neceſſity uſe them for the confutation of ſeveral Errours.</p>
                  <p>But we cannot aſcribe further to any mans Interpretations and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences an <hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:164278:23"/> any more by their perverſe interpretations and opinions: namely,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we know, that their own particular interpretations &amp; inferences muſt <hi>not be neceſſary unto Salvation,</hi> becauſe they do either <hi>aſſert</hi> &amp; affirm ſome new doctrin, which is not ſo manifeſtly and expreſsly aſſerted in the word of God, or <hi>deny</hi> ſome what, which is not ſo plainly denied therein; That both we and other Chriſtians can in conſcience acknowledge and receive the ſame, or the Primitive undoubted true-beleeving Church could have unanimouſly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch a meaning &amp; ſence thereof: Which is a certain &amp; infallible ſign that it muſt be either a falſe perverted, or at leaſt an unneceſſary interpretation or meaning; and that we therefore may reject it as unneceſſary with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but they may not with a ſafe conſcience diſturbe the Church of God with ſuch unneceſſary new doctrines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When they cry up ſuch interpretations and opinions of theirs (though we certainly know them not to be neceſſary) not only for <hi>neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith</hi> or Gods Commandements, and their owne words, for meere words of God: Then we know further undoubtedly, that they are juſt ſuch Prophets as God hath warned us from; <hi>Who ſhall preſume to ſpeak, in his name that which he hath not commanded them to ſpeak?</hi> Deut. 18.19, 20.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How much more when they by their own interpretations and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions in doctrine of Faith and life, do not only affirme or deny ſome what, which in the word of God is not ſo expreſsly affirmed or denied, but alſo do <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme</hi> ſome things which are ſo evidently and expreſsly <hi>denied</hi> therein, or <hi>deny</hi> ſome things, which are ſo expreſsly <hi>affirmed</hi> therein, that all learned Chriſtians, who will but underſtand them, and not out of carnall affections ſticke unto them, may comprehend them without any difficultie; nay, it being evident and palpable to every one, that thoſe Interpretations and opinions of theirs are but meerly ſtrained and ſpun out of their own fancies, and not grounded upon the text and words of the Scripture it ſelf, or equivalent places of it; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the true Primitive undoubted Church, having with one accord taught ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutly the contrary: Thoſe, if they in ſuch a manner obtrude and urge their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:164278:23"/> own forced Interpretations, or rather perverſions of the Scripture, both <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> and <hi>against</hi> the manifeſt Word of God, as neceſſary <hi>as the Word of God it ſelf,</hi> and thereby deny or pervert the true neceſſary Articles of Faith or Precepts of God, and that obſtinately, as hath been mentioned before: They are not onely like to thoſe Prophets <hi>who preſume to ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, that which he hath not commanded them to ſpeak,</hi> but alſo like them <hi>that ſpeak in the name of other gods,</hi> Deut. 18.20. <hi>becauſe they will thrust as out of the way which the Lord our God hath commanded to walk in,</hi> Deut. 13.25.

                  <p>Whereby, I hope, every one may ſee, that by the often-mentioned ground of the manifeſt Scriptures, not onely no occaſion is given to the erroneous Sects, but rather the Sectaries mouth may be ſtopped with much facility and ſafety, and with more efficacie then by many ſubtil and endleſſe Altercations and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, or by <hi>all-Excommunications and Perſecutions of Hereticks:</hi> although we do diſapprove alſo this to be uſed againſt manifeſt obſtinate Blaſphemers, as <hi>Serve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was, who vomited ſuch terrible and horrid Blaſphemies and contumelious words againſt the holy and bleſſed Trinity, that they are noways to be ſuffered amongſt Chriſtians: Or when they under the colour of Religion plot Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Inſurrections againſt legal Magiſtrates, as formerly <hi>Munzerus</hi> and the Anabaptiſts at <hi>Munſter</hi> did, which is not juſtifiable, though it happeneth for true Religion, much leſſe for erroneous Doctrines ſake.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe that peaceably and cloſely adhere to the words of the Scripture, without maintaining and introducing ſingular By-Interpretations and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theirs, as hath been told; thoſe, I ſay, though they do not receive ours or any other particular Churches true Interpretations and expreſſions, we cannot nor will therefore judge as Hereticks, but ought to tolerate and receive as weak brethren in faith, as it hath been ſaid many times heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Which we may illuſtrate with one or two Examples: <hi>As the first Chapter of John,</hi> which the Primitive Church (whoſe Writings and Doctrines are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended and conveyed to us, whereof no doubt but it hath together with the Books of the Scripture received alſo from the Apoſtles themſelves the true meaning thereof, at leaſt in the principal neceſſary points, of which this si one) hath Unanimouſly and Undoubtedly interpreted of <hi>the Son of God, who was in the beginning of all things, as the Subſtantial Word with the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Modern Socinians interpret it of the beginning of the Goſpel and the humane nature of Chriſt, to the end that they may deny the Article of Chriſts Godhead; we rightly reject ſuch Interpretation not onely as not neceſſary, but as falſe and heretical, not that it is onely contrary to our Interpretation, but that it is ſo manifeſtly repugnant to the words of Saint <hi>John,</hi> that the Primitive Church hath with one conſent taught the contrary: Inſomuch alſo that none of the Ancient <hi>Arrians,</hi> or <hi>Photinians,</hi> to our and all Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ever thus underſtood or expounded it; But <hi>Socinus</hi> was the firſt man, as he himſelf muſt confeſſe, that ſpun this Interpretation out of his own head, wherein at firſt his own brethren have partly contradicted him: Yet ſince
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:164278:24"/> that time hath he together with his followers preferred it, as if it were the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Word of God it ſelf, and a moſt neceſſary Interpretation, before the words of Saint <hi>John</hi> and the Uniform meaning of the Primitive Church. Which may not be done without great preſumption, nor if it be obſtinately urged, without damnable Hereſie, principally in ſuch a deep, important and neceſſary Article of Faith, as it is accounted not onely by us, but the true Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church and the word of God it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, if they in ſuch profound and incomprehenſible Myſterie did adhere poſitively and cloſely, without mutilation and contention, to the words of the Scripture, nor added thereunto their own Interpretations and Inferences of their reaſoning, beyond and againſt the Articles of Faith; we ſhould then have no cauſe to judge them ſo ſharply, though they would not receive or uſe all our expoſitions or humane expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, when <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers do wreſt and pervert ſo many manifeſt places of the Scripture, which ſpeak <hi>of Chriſts death,</hi> that he <hi>died for the propitiation, ſatisfaction, and remiſſion of our ſins,</hi> to this ſenſe, as if he had not appeaſed Gods wrath againſt us, or which is as much, made ſatisfaction to appeaſe Gods wrath, or purchaſed, propitiation and forgiveneſſe: but that he died meerly to this end, that he might by his doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample convert us from our ſins to God, and to pacifie our hearts towards him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And account their own Interpretations as worthy and neceſſary as Gods Word it ſelf; So that they grievouſly ſlight and revile the Doctrine concerning the reconcilation of Gods wrath againſt us, and the ſatisfaction for our ſins, which nevertheleſſe is ſo manifeſtly and evidently taught by ſo many teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture, that the Univerſal Chriſtian Church hath profeſſed it with one accord at all times, and ever therefore held Jeſus Chriſt for its onely High-Prieſt, Mediatour, and Saviour; Inſomuch that even the greateſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, though they ſupply by way of concomitancy the merits of Chriſt, by the Interceſſion and merits of other Saints, and their own merits and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, the daily Sacrifice of Maſſe, Indulgences, Purgatory, and ſuch like things; yet have not denied the propitiation by Chriſts merits and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor any other Sectary, as far as we know, nor <hi>Pelagius</hi> himſelf hath directly oppoſed it, except onely <hi>Socinus,</hi> and perhaps before him <hi>Adailer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:</hi> Whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf cannot but acknowledge that the Mediatour of the Old Teſtament <hi>Moſes</hi> hath in ſome manner appeaſed by his interceſſion (as <hi>Aaron</hi> and ſome other high-Prieſts by their Sacrifices) Gods wrath againſt his people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and yet will deny ſuch power and vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins to the moſt-perfect Obedience, Sacrifice and Interceſſion of our Mediatour and high-Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt. Who ſeeth not then, that they intend arrogantly to prefer their own ſingular Interpretations before the manifeſt Word of God, and the unanimous conſent of the Univerſal Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and thereby, as much as lies in their power, ſhake and ſubvert the very foundation of our chief conſolation in Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">The Second Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Second place may be objected againſt the aforeſaid ground of Saving Truth and Unitie, that nevertheleſſe the Primitive Chriſtian Church hath condemned many Sects not onely for not receiving the plain words of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:164278:24"/> Scripture, but alſo for refuſing the <hi>Interpretations and words of the Church.</hi> For example, The ancient <hi>Arrians</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nicen</hi> and others,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Conſubſtantial,</hi> alledging that ſuch a word was not to be found in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>But we Anſwer to this: That they were not condemned even for this bare word, but rather becauſe of their peculiar <hi>Arrian</hi> phraſe and expreſſions, and expoſitions <hi>concerning the created Divinitie of Chriſt.</hi> Againſt whom the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall and true-beleeving Church, did very earneſtly inſiſt upon the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which though not in the letter, yet it is found in the Scripture more plainly and evidently and more conformably to the unanimous underſtanding and meaning which the Churches in the firſt three hundred yeers profeſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eternall God-head of Chriſt; not that it was directly neceſſary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation, but conducible to the confutation of the ambiguous terms and opinions of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> Otherwiſe there hath been in thoſe times true-belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Biſhops, who, though they had rejected the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie concerning the <hi>created Divinitie of Chriſt,</hi> and yet doubted of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe it was not to be found literally in the Scripture, were therefore not condemned, but tolerated as weak in Faith.</p>
                  <p>This very ſame we may ſay of all other ancient Sectaries, <hi>Macedonius, Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Eutiches, Pelagius,</hi> which were at all times condemned for their ſingular new fangled Interpretations, out of the word of God, according to the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous meaning and doctrine of the Churches in the firſt three or four hundred yeers.</p>

I will give but a touch in ſome few, but principall Inſtances; <hi>That we deny the free will in man, the merits of good works, and the Sacrifice of the Maſſe:</hi> Which points were with one conſent aſſerted of all ancient Fathers almoſt: <hi>That we teach the Juſtification, ex Solâ fide, onely by Faith.</hi> That we hold the Bread and the Wine in the Supper of the Lord <hi>to be bare ſignes and Seales,</hi> whereby the Body and Blood of Chriſt is but <hi>Signified,</hi> and not really given: That we defend <hi>Abſolutum decretum,</hi> that God freely without any reſpect of Faith or Unbelief, good or evill works of men, hath decreed in his eternall Councell, to elect and chooſe ſome unto Salvation, others &amp; the greateſt part to caſt away and reject as Reprobates, unto damnation: <hi>Alſo,</hi> That we underſtand by <hi>Chriſts going down into Hell,</hi> the helliſh paines and torments Chriſts Soul ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:164278:25"/> Laſtly, that we hold the Pope at <hi>Rome</hi> to be <hi>the great Antichrist:</hi> Which Articles of Doctrine, are neither plainly expreſſed in the Scripture, nor by the Ancient Doctors of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformed Churches. 1. Of Free-will.</note>
                     <hi>We Anſwer:</hi> Firſt that we do not deny <hi>the free will in man,</hi> in that ſence and meaning, as ſome, and all the Ancient Fathers have taught out of the Scripture. For we confeſſe, 1. That <hi>the Naturall man</hi> hath a Free-will <hi>in many Naturall and Temporall</hi> Free indifferent matters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Celeſtiall Spirituall things to many <hi>Outward ſins,</hi> either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or to avoid them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea alſo to many <hi>Outward good works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the <hi>Regenerate</hi> man hath a true Free-will, or which is made Free by the grace of God to true <hi>Spirituall</hi> works, which are acceptable to God: Yet ſo, that not onely the beginning, but alſo the continuall help and aſſiſtance of Gods grace is required unto it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This onely we deny, That the <hi>Naturall unregenerated man</hi> hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, without the preventing gracious help and operation of the holy Ghoſt, any Freewill to <hi>true Spirituall inward works,</hi> which are acceptable to God, as to Saving Faith, Charity, Hope, and conſequently <hi>to the true Spirituall outward works,</hi> which ariſe from thoſe inward. Which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the holy Scripture hath unanimouſly taught againſt <hi>Pelagius: That the Naturall man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him, neither can be know them,</hi> 1 Corinthians, 2. verſe 14. <hi>And that we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Corinthians 3. verſe 5. <hi>For it is God, which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Philipp. 2. Verſe 13. <hi>He that hath begun a good worke in us, will alſo performe it,</hi> Philippians 1. Verſe 6. <hi>Without him we can do nothing,</hi> John 15. Verſe 5. <hi>For we are by nature the Children of wrath, dead in ſins,</hi> Epheſians 2. Verſe 5. <hi>And he that obeyeth ſin, is the Servant of Sin,</hi> Romans 6. Verſe 16.20. 2 Peter 2. Verſe 19. <hi>But if the Sonne maketh us free, wee ſhall be free indeed,</hi> John 8. verſe 34.36. <hi>And faithfull is he that calleth you, who alſo will doe it,</hi> 1 Theſſalonians 5. verſe 24.</p>
                  <p>But if there be beſides any other controverſie of mans Free-will, or Gods gracious help; we hold neither theirs, nor our particular opinions to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Salvation, eſpecially for all Chriſtians, who oftentimes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand but little or nothing at all of ſuch ſubtil queſtions, and therefore ought not to judge nor condemne one another.</p>
                  <p>Like as amongſt the Papiſts themſelves, the modern Dominicans and Jeſuites cannot agree about theſe queſtions, nothwithſtanding the prohibition made by the Pope not to accuſe and condemne one another for errours in Faith.</p>

                     <note place="margin">2. Of merits of good works.</note>2. Nor do we deny the <hi>merits of good works</hi> in that ſence as the ancient Fathers uſe the word <hi>Meritum</hi> deſert, or <hi>Mereri</hi> to deſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> That we obtaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by temporall and eternall <hi>remuneration by grace,</hi> for Chriſts ſake in vertue of his promiſe: Which we confeſſe unanimouſly with them by warrants of the Scripture. But we deny onely <hi>Meritum de condigno,</hi> as the Papiſt School-authors
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:164278:25"/> and Divines, principally the Jeſuites do teach, that ſuch in themſelves are <hi>condigne meritorious works of eternall life,</hi> ſo that God is bound to give ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, not onely by reaſon of his <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> for Chriſts ſake, but alſo <hi>of right</hi> and <hi>debt,</hi> though he had not ingaged himſelf thereunto by any promiſe: Which <hi>condigne</hi> meritorious works were never taught either by the Scripture, or by the ancient Fathers, but are rejected of many Schoole-authors and Divines; yea by many moderne Roman Catholicks themſelves: As the famous Jeſuite <hi>Vasques</hi> confeſſeth, that many Catholickes diſſent from us (calling us Hereticks) but in words, but moſt agree with us, in the matter it ſelfe, and condiſcend of neceſſity unto our opinion. And the Jeſuits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not as yet agreed, wherein properly the Efficacy and worthineſſe of ſuch Condigne merits of works conſiſteth. <hi>Vide Bellarm. de Juſtific.</hi> lib. 5. c. 17. <hi>Suarez.</hi> in 3. <hi>Thom.

                     <note place="margin">3. Of the Maſſe.</note> it is ſufficiently evident and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that there is nothing plainly and expreſsly taught and declared thereof, either in the Inſtitution of the Lords Supper, or in the whole volume of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And although ſome, or all the Ancient Fathers had taught it; yet it could not be received for an Article neceſſary unto Salvation, becauſe they had not taught it out of the word of God; and, becauſe Faith, love, and obedience of Chriſts Commandments and Inſtitution, may very well ſubſiſt without the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is certaine, that even the Ancient Doctors of the Church never have taught ſuch Sacrifice of the Maſſe, as now a dayes in <hi>Popery</hi> is profeſſed and held for the Soveraigne Worſhip, and chiefeſt part of Religion. For although they called the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper <hi>Miſſam,</hi> and that from thence, becauſe the <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> thoſe that were not yet Baptized, were uſually diſmiſſed from it, with theſe words, <hi>Ite, Miſſa est:</hi> And although they have attributed the name of <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Holy Communion it ſelfe; yet they did it not in ſuch a ſence and meaning, that the Prieſt ſhould offer againe the real and eſſentiall body of Chriſt in his hand and mouth; and alſo performe a new Propitiatory Sacrifice both for the quick and dead, and for other neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (as for ſicke Cattell, for good weather,) as it is taught and expreſſed in the Councell of <hi>Trent, Seſſ.</hi> 22. c. 2. v. 9. <hi>Canon.</hi> 1.3. But that it is <hi>Sacrificium Eucharisticum,</hi> a Sacrifice of Thankſgiving; partly becauſe the faithfull gathered and collected the Bread and Wine upon the Lords Table for the Holy Communion and neceſſitiy of the poor; (from whence the <hi>Germans</hi> retain ſtill the name of <hi>Oblate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, That man ſolâ Fide, onely by Faith is accounted righteous before God,</hi> Although we underſtand nothing elſe by the word <hi>ſolâ,</hi> but what the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">4.

                     <note place="margin">5. The true meaning and declaration of Chriſts words in the Holy Communion.</note>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The declaration and meaning of Chriſts Word that he called the Bread his Body, becauſe it did <hi>ſignifie and repreſent</hi> his Body, or becauſe it is a <hi>ſigne</hi> of his Body. Although we for our part acknowledge this expoſition to be agreeable both to the words and very end of the Inſtitution, and to all the Articles of Faith, and that ſome ancient Fathers, <hi>Tertullian, Augustine, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> and others have expounded it thus: As the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do not deny the bleſſed Bread and Wine to be ſignes and ſeals of the Body and Blood of Chriſt given and ſhed for us: Yet we deſire not to inforce and preſſe upon any man ſuch interpretation as neceſſary unto ſalvation, or as the Word of God it ſelf: Whereas many of ours (<hi>vide inprimis Wolfang. Muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in</hi> 26 <hi>Matth. pag.</hi> 552, 554, 555.) confeſſe openly, that this expoſition, though it be not erroneous in it ſelf, yet is not <hi>ſufficient,</hi> unleſſe it did ſhew and expreſſe withall the ſort and nature of thoſe ſignes: <hi>viz.</hi> not bare naked <hi>ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative and repreſentative ſignes,</hi> nor bare <hi>hiſtorical ſymbols and tokens of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, but ſigna exhibitiva,</hi> exhibiting and certifying pledges and aſſurances, whereby the things ſignified by them, namely, the Body of Chriſt, which hath been given for us, the Blood of Chriſt, that is ſhed for us, are really and verily by vertue of his promiſe, though not <hi>for the nouriſhing of our bodies, but to the cheriſhing and quickning of our ſouls,</hi> delivered and appropriated unto us, and likewiſe really and verily received by us, though not <hi>corporally and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> by our mouth; but <hi>ſpiritually</hi> by faith: As the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> themſelves do not deny ſuch ſpiritual partaking as hath been ſaid before, but acknowledge it to be the onely ſaving Communion.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we for our part teach thereby no new Doctrine as neceſſary unto Salvation, but onely teach that very ſame, they themſelves muſt allow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of: If but they reciprocally do not inforce upon us their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Interpretations, as hath been mentioned oftentimes already, nor judge and condemn us therefore, but give us liberty to adhere to the Words and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> But as long as they intend to obtrude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us their pretended carnal ſupernatural eating for a neceſſary Article of Faith, we cannot but contradict it by a more ſolide expoſition and illation grounded upon the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Gods abſolute purpoſe and decree of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:164278:26"/> and reprobation,</hi> we acknowledge and receive it thus far, as our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries commonly conſtrue our meaning thereof, not onely for no neceſſary Doctrine of Faith, but alſo not for the proper Doctrine and Opinion of our Churches: Being that ſuch a term is not expreſſed in any general Confeſſions, but onely uſed by ſome Divines, which yet others do rather abſolutely forbear, becauſe of the miſapplication and abuſes with all ſorts of calumnies that may ariſe from them.</p>
                  <p>And although we finde many diſceptations and different Interpretations concerning the eternal Predeſtination and Reprobation, not onely betwixt our Divines, but alſo betwixt the <hi>Romiſh</hi>-School Authors amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no leſſe between the ſaid <hi>Lutherans:</hi> Yet we cannot receive either theirs or our particular opinions for neceſſary Doctrines, which are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all Chriſtians, without the manifeſt Word of God and unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Primitive Church; not onely becauſe very few men are capable to comprehend the depth and profunditie of thoſe Points; but alſo, becauſe it is ſufficient for us unto ſalvation, to know onely of the Elect and Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated as much as the Apoſtle expreſly teacheth: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6. <hi>That God hath choſen us in Chriſt before the foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love, having predestinated us unto the Adoption of children by Jeſus Christ unto himſelf according to the good pleaſure of his Will, To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he made us accepted in the beloved.</hi> Epheſ. 2. verſ. 8, 9, 10. 2 Tim. 1. verſ. 9. <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves; it is the gift of God; not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. For we are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Contrarywiſe concerning the Reprobates, it ſufficeth us to know one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that what Chriſt himſelf ſaith: <hi>He that beleeveth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not beleeved in the Name of the onely begotten Son of God,</hi> John 3. verſ. 18.</p>
                  <p>So that the fault and defect can no wayes be imputed to God, who himſelf taketh no delight in the death and deſtruction of a ſinner, but will, that he may repent and live; not willing that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23, 32. and 33. <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. 2 <hi>Petr.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. But the fault and defect lieth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and totally in themſelves, who loved darkneſſe rather then light, and therefore receive not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved, <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>So that we are elected not out of any conſideration and reſpect in our ſelves, but out of meer grace in Chriſt Jeſus both unto ſalvation and the means or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained thereunto; <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit, and beleef of the Truth, whereunto he called us through the Gospel,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are caſt away by Gods juſt judgement, becauſe of their ſins, unbeleef, and impenitency, unto the juſt puniſhment and condemnation of ſins; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of the Lord: <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy help,</hi> Hoſ. 13. v. 9.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:164278:27"/>
                  <p>Moreover, all other Diſputes and Controverſies of the predeſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates which may be moved and debated on, as, Why God to one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, or to a Nation, though by nature equally corrupted in ſins, hath ſhewed more grace towards their repentance and ſalvation then to another? Or, Why God hath not predeſtinated all men unto life, or converted and ſaved them all; which according to his Omnipotency he was well able to do? And ſuch like things, which are not onely curious and unneceſſary, but vain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, unprofitable queſtion, to which we cannot return a better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer then the Apoſtle did: <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, (viz.</hi> out of meer grace) <hi>and whom he will he hardneth, viz.</hi> out of juſt Judgement. <hi>But, O man, who art thou, that repliest against God?</hi> Rom. 9. v. 18, 20. <hi>O how unſearchable are his judgements and his wayes paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. v. 33.</p>
                  <p>But whoſoever will not be ſatisfied with this anſwer of the Apoſtle, he will have as little cauſe to condemn thereby us and our Church, as to judge the Apoſtle himſelf or the ancient Fathers, <hi>Auguſtine, Prosper, Fulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and others, who have taught this ſame againſt <hi>Pelagius:</hi> Or as the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> their <hi>Dominican-Friars:</hi> Or as the Modern <hi>Lutherans</hi> their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſome other ancient <hi>Lutherans,</hi> who have taught this very ſame doctrine, and yet partly uſed harſher expreſſions then ever was done of our ſide.</p>

                     <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi> 2. we call it not into queſtion, though not onely we amongſt our ſelves, but alſo the ancient Fathers, and alſo the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> do much differ, in their explications; where, for our part, we ought to diſtinguiſh betwixt that which by moſt certain Warrants of Gods Word is undeniable and neceſſary to beleeve, and that which is uncertain and doubtful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Papiſts</hi> commonly interpret it of <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> A Lake for the ſouls of the beleeving Patriarchs and our Forefathers of the Old Teſtament, from whence Chriſt by his going down thereunto, hath looſed and fetched them forth. Now ſuppoſe that this opinion were true and certain (though the ancient Fathers and Doctors of the Church do not agree in it) yet it could
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:164278:27"/> not be neceſſary unto our ſalvation, neither would yeeld to us any profit or comfort, ſince it doth onely concern the faithful Patriarchs.</p>
                  <p>Much leſſe is it neceſſary for our ſalvation, that Chriſt is really with his ſoul deſcended into the <hi>Hell of the damned,</hi> as ſome even of the ancient Fathers deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he preached to the damned in Hell, and delivered ſome out of it; which conjecture ſimply aroſe from the miſapprehenſion of the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. and 4. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two opinions now, if not as erroneous and falſe, yet as uncertain and doubtful, and as not neceſſary unto ſalvation, laid aſide; At leaſt thus much is undeniable and undoubted, that Chriſt is deſcended into Hell <hi>virtua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter,</hi> as <hi>Thom. Aqu.</hi> and other School-Authors and Divines interpret it, which is to ſay, <hi>powerfully and effectually,</hi> where he by his death during three dayes and his enſuing Reſurrection hath not onely deſtroyed the <hi>place of Hell</hi> for the damned, but the <hi>Kingdom and power of Hell</hi> for the faithful and godly, led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive, and diſabled the <hi>Helliſh ſpirits</hi> of all power over us. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even this is meant by the going down to Hell expreſſed in the Creed, is to be doubted of for this reaſon, becauſe the place of the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> whereon this Article chiefly is grounded, ſpeaketh rather of the loweſt degree of humiliation, from whence he hath been exalted by his Reſurrection, then of the beginning of his exaltation.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe it is without Controverſie granted, that Chriſt hath ſuffered for our ſins not onely in his Body, but alſo in his Soul <hi>unspeakable torments,</hi> which in the Scripture are called <hi>the pains and ſorrows of Hell, Pſalm.</hi> 18. and 116. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6. So that many of our Divines have extracted this conſtruction and ſenſe out of this Article: Yet not ſo, as if Chriſt had ſuffered in his Soul the very pains of the damned, or any deſpaire, as the <hi>Papists</hi> by miſ-conſtruction of their words do charge them withall; but that he in his Soul out of a tender affection towards us, ſuffered as great pains, diſtreſſe, and ſorrows for our ſins and Gods wrath againſt us, which he took upon him to appeaſe, as if they had been his own ſins, or we our ſelves ſhould ſuffer for our ſins in Hell. Which no wayes can be accounted for a new, erroneous, and damnable Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grounded upon ſo evident Warrants of the Word of God; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. and 69. and 88. <hi>Jeſ.</hi> 53. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 37, 38. and 27. <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 44. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7.

                  <p>And although no Chriſtian can make any ſcruple of the diſtreſſe and pains Chriſt ſuffered in his Soul; yet a great many of our Divines move here the Queſtion, and not without reaſon, Whether this is the very meaning of the Article expreſſed in the Creed, or of the aforementioned places in the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> and 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Acts,</hi> becauſe thoſe pains took their end upon the Croſſe, and therefore are comprehended in the Articles of the <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Crucifixion;</hi> but the looſing from the bonds of Death and Hell, whereof <hi>David</hi> and the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, was fulfilled by his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:164278:28"/> or Sepulchre, whereof the aforealledged places do ſpeak, and that alſo the Ancients formerly omitted the Article of Chriſts Burial, when this Article was put into the Creed.</p>
                  <p>Others interpret it generally of the <hi>eſtate and condition Chriſts Soul was in during three dayes,</hi> that, like other ſouls, it departed out of this World till the third day, and according to the ordinary Phraſe of the Scripture, was gathered unto his Fathers.

                  <p>So that by this Article is meant nothing elſe, but that Chriſts ſoul after his death made no ſtay in this World, but departed, like other mens ſouls to the place of the dead, and as if it were holden of the bonds of death till the third day, yet in Gods hands; which was indeed the loweſt degree of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas in the mean while the World triumphed over him as over a dead man who went to Hell, till at length it was made manifeſt by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that he deſcended not to the Hell of the damned, but to the <hi>Sheol</hi> or <hi>Grave</hi> to the faithful Patriarchs; As the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>By all which expoſitions doth manifeſtly appear that the two firſt opinions maintained by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> neither are ſolide and certain, nor neceſſary; The others, which partly they, partly we defend, as much as concerneth the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in it ſelf, are conſonant and agreeable to the Word of God and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly received of all Chriſtians; though the Controverſie remaineth ſtill; which of them draweth neereſt to the true opinion of this Article in the Creed: And withall that we do not introduce any new Doctrine in this Article as neceſſary to ſalvation, being we give to every one liberty in his opinion, except in that which is agreed on of all ſides. Which is alſo the ſafeſt way and ſufficient unto ſalvation, if of this Article we do but generally ſo much know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Chriſts Soul having ſuffered the extremeſt diſtreſſe and ſorrow on Earth, <hi>verily departed to the dead,</hi> who are kept in the hands of his Father till the day of Reſurrection: Although we do not even determine the place, that it deſcended really to the Hell of the damned, or to a certain <hi>Limbus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Earth, before it entred into Paradiſe, which the Lord promiſed to the theef upon the Croſſe; being we yet imbrace the moſt indubitable and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain comfort ariſing from this Article, that Chriſt by ſuch departure of his Soul hath delivered our ſouls from all the torments and pains of Hell, to the end that they confidently might follow him out of this World, without fear of Hell, into that Inviſible World, whetherto the Lord hath prepared the way by his deceaſing.</p>

                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>great Antichriſt,</hi> of whom the Scripture doth ſo much propheſie; Like as it is not directly neceſſary unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to know that ſuch an Antichriſt is to come (although it is requiſite to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:164278:28"/> beleeve it for them that have the knowledge of it out of the Word of God, as hath been ſaid heretofore;) Alſo much leſſe is it neceſſary to ſalvation to know and to determine who is that great Antichriſt, except unto them onely to whom God hath perfectly revealed it. And notwithſtanding many of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, though not generally all, are of this opinion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> from that time he hath taken upon him to be inſtead of Chriſt the Univerſal and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of the whole Chriſtian Church, over all Emperours and Kings and over all mens ſouls (which hath been ſpecially obſerved ſince the time of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh) is that great Antichriſt: yet they do not teach it even as a <hi>neceſſary Article of Faith,</hi> but as an <hi>Interpretation of the Prophetical Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which are very agreeable to Truth, yea partly accounted by them for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubted, ſince they have the experience by the event, hiſtories, and writings of the Popes themſelves, that whatſoever hath been propheſied of the Antichriſt, is now fulfilled in theſe Popes. And although this opinion of theirs muſt of neceſſity be thus far new, becauſe the Primitive Church could know no certainty of it before the accompliſhing and revealing of the Antichriſt: Yet it is not ſo new neither; whereas this name hath been attributed to the Popes ſome hundred yeers before <hi>Luther</hi>'s times, even by ſome <hi>German</hi> Emperours and Biſhops, and among others by the Emperour <hi>Lewys</hi> the fourth Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> three hundred yeers ago; Yea, when before 1460 yeers <hi>Irenaeus</hi> out of the Revelation of <hi>S. John</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 18. conjectured by his name, that he would be called <hi>Latinus,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Romane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe <hi>not the whole Romane Church, nor all its Members, neither all their Doctrine and Rel gion</hi> is therefore to be accounted for Antichriſtian. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. But the Doctrine of Chriſt, which is left amongſt them, ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from the Doctrine and traditions of the Pope, and the Temple and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, over which he extendeth unjuſtly his Supreme Juriſdiction and Dominion, from the Pope and his Dependents, as it is propheſied of in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>But if the <hi>Pope</hi> or the <hi>Papiſts</hi> would reject or confute ſuch opinion of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as erroneous; They cannot perform it better then <hi>by the deed it ſelf,</hi> ordering matters in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That hereafter he do not anymore exalt himſelf over the Gods on Earth, over Emperours and Kings, to depoſe &amp; deprive them of their Crowns, and diſcharge the Subjects from their Oath, obedience, and ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That he do not attribute to himſelf the power belonging onely to Chriſt, over the ſouls and conſciences of men, or over Chriſtian Doctrine and Religion, by adding thereunto and diminiſhing from it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and principally, That he do not Antichriſtian-like excommunicate and perſecute thoſe that do not acknowledge him as Univerſal and Supreme Head of the whole Chriſtian Church. In doing ſo, none of our ſide will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him for an Antichriſt, nor his Dependents for Antichriſtian. Otherwiſe, although they ſhould erre or exceed in holding him to be the great Antichriſt, when perhaps a greater yet is to come: Yet the Popes would have as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to charge them therefore with a damnable errour, as the Wolves the Sheep, for accounting that for the ravenouſeſt Wolf which hath devoured moſt Sheep.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:164278:29"/>
                  <p>Thus we hope by theſe eight Points of moment, wherein we are accuſed of new Doctrine, is apparently and abundantly made clear and evident, (which alſo we could as eaſily have performed in all other Articles;) That we have introduced no Innovation of Doctrine, but rather for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the ancient undoubted Doctrine, ſeparated again whatſoever hath been added to the Univerſal Primitive Chriſtian Doctrine in the latter hundred yeers.</p>
                  <p>To which end all the Reformed Churches have generally at all times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves by ſolemn Proteſtations, that they would hearken to no new Doctrine, but punctually and poſitively adhere to the ancient Catholick Apoſtolick Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>So that the principal difference betwixt us and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> doth not properly concern the Doctrine, which we for our part maintain as neceſſary unto ſalvation, but onely the by-Doctrines and additions, which they for their part have innovated, and beſides the Univerſal undoubted Chriſtian Doctrine will inforce upon us as neceſſary; but we reject either as falſe and erroneous, or at leaſt as unneceſſary and doubtful.</p>
                  <p>For notwithſtanding ſome <hi>new Interpretations</hi> of ſome place of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſome <hi>new opinions</hi> in ſome Controverſie may be found amongſt our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, (as they are very obvious and ordinary amongſt the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>-Divines) yet by ſuch ſingular Interpretation of ſome dark places of the Scripture, no new Doctrine is introduced, but grounded upon more evident Warrants: Or though one or other ſhould maintain ſome new opinions, yet they are not preſſed by them or by the Univerſal Church for neceſſary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, but liberty is given therein for each ones opinion: Yea, there are ſome which are not approved of at all, but rather rejected and ſet by: Like as not onely we, but the <hi>Papists</hi> themſelves do not approve and allow of every thing expreſſed in the moſt ancient and principal monuments and writings of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>But in caſe One or ſome of ours would cry up and urge their own ſingular opinions as neceſſary to ſalvation, With thoſe we ſhould finde even as much fault as with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Lutherans:</hi>

                  <head>Concluſion of the firſt Part.</head>
                  <p>BY all this, what hitherto hath been declared, every underſtanding and conſciencious man may without partiality and paſſion judge and diſcern whether there is any lawful ground or reaſon to judge and condemn us or our Church as heretical, becauſe of our Doctrine and Religion: Whereas we for our part preſcribe not to other men any Doctrine as neceſſary unto ſalvation, except onely what is ſo evidently and expreſly grounded upon the Word of God, that they themſelves with us, muſt receive for certain and undoubted, or the Primitive Church hath received and taught unanimouſly, nor contrary wiſe do we deny any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is thus neceſſary: Though we cannot acknowledge and receive each particular Interpretation or Inference, which either of the different parties accounteth for neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Now, If we may not juſtly be judged or condemned for the very Doctrine of all our Churches in general; much leſſe may we be judged then for ſome different and controverted doctrine or expreſſions, which peradventure have been maintained by particular Teachers, and not generally approved by all the Churches or by our ſelves, who are cryed down for Hereticks: For it is ſaid: <hi>By thy words</hi> (and not by other mens words) <hi>thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned, Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 37. Much leſſe then for ſuch Doctrines, which neither we nor any of ours have ever maintained, but are laid to our charge by dreadful ſlanders or miſ-conſtruction and perverſion of our words and meaning, or by groundleſſe vain Scholaſtick
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:164278:30"/> conſequences and illations, as that <hi>we deny Gods Truth, Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Juſtice, and Mercy,</hi> that <hi>we make God to be an Hypocrite, a Tyrant, Author of ſin, yea a Divel,</hi> and more ſuch like unchriſtian, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and very diabolical calumnies, which we for our part commit to the Supreme and Soveraign Judge, and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſay with the Apoſtle to all thoſe that are yet inclinable to Chriſtian Peace and Unitie: <hi>Let us not judge one another any more; what art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth. There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, who art thou that judgeſt another.</hi> James 4. v. 12.</p>
                  <p>And if it be, that we ſhall not raſhly judge one another with words, how much worſe is it then; When they from a verbal judging fall at length to a <hi>cruell and bloody perſecution with fire and ſword, or other violences</hi> againſt life, goods, honour, and dignities? When they not onely excommunicate and cut off from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, but if poſſibly could be, exclude from mens ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and extirpate from the face of the Earth thoſe who onely profeſſe Chriſt and his Word, and will not heark and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance humane doctrines and traditions. This is the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty courſe of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> whom God alſo in his due time will judge accordingly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, having hitherto been informed by the firſt part of this Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall rule: Wherein, and why we ought not to judge one another; Let us now go on and learn alſo by the ſecond part; whether, and how far we ought and are bound in conſcience to judge in matters of Religion? We alſo ſhall eaſily thereby diſcern which ſide of the modern diſſenting parts tranſgreſſeth or exceedeth therein; and which part is guilty of the pernicious <hi>Schiſme, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> and of the great ſcandall and other diſtractions of the modern Chriſtian Church from thence ariſing; And withall, whether, and

                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle teacheth us in the ſaid place, that we ought principally to judge this, <hi>That no man put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in his brothers way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where, Firſt is to be obſerved, that this judging he ſpeaketh of is referred rather <hi>to the matter,</hi> to the works and words, to the Doctrine, practice, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whereby any offence may be given, then <hi>to the perſons;</hi> And that prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>to our own affaires, words and works,</hi> whereby we may put any ſtumbling block and offence in the way either of <hi>our neighbour,</hi> or of <hi>our ſelves;</hi> Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <hi>to the matters of our neighbour,</hi> as far as he may become unto us, or we unto him a ſtumbling block or offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be noted, that he doth not properly ſpeak of the offence <hi>of affections,</hi> whereby we or our neighbour is provoked to anger, afflicted, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and alienated from us: but of the offence of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> whereby either our own Conſcience is wounded, by going againſt Conſcience, or the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is miſſe-led into errours or ſinnes of Conſcience; or he being already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in errours and ſinnes of Conſcience, is by us ſtrengthned and confirmed therein. But we need alſo to take heed of the offence of affections and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ariſing from them as much as poſſibly may be, according to the rule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> Yet not ſo neither, that we give thereby an offence to our Conſcience, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by reaſon of the <hi>outward peace with men,</hi> ſhould deſtroy and loſe <hi>the inward peace of Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is indubitabe hereby, that the Apoſtle requireth nothing elſe, but that we for our part <hi>give or put no occaſion to fall</hi> in any mans way. Which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, when we either commit that which is evill, and omit that which is good, or abuſe ſo our liberty in indiffent things, that the weak are <hi>ſcandalized</hi> at our example; which is to ſay, offended, <hi>made worſe</hi> thereby, and miſ-led into errors and ſinnes. But it is no wayes required from us, that we, for the avoiding of ſuch ſcandall and offence, which others without cauſe, either out of weaknes or malice <hi>receive</hi> at us, in doing what is good, and omitting what is evill, ſhould therefore omit that which is good, and commit that which is evill. <hi>For we muſt not do evill, that good may come,</hi> Rom. 3. <hi>v.</hi> 8. Not wound our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that another mans erroneous Conſcience may not be offended; Yea, we need not neither forſake our liberty in indifferent matters, becauſe of thoſe that are offended at them out a Phariſaicall hypocriſie and malice, or judge and condemn us but only for their ſake which are weak in faith. But againſt the others we muſt often times of neceſſity ſtick faſt to the <hi>liberty</hi> for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but this, l ſt they may impoſe on us a <hi>neceſſity</hi> againſt that liberty which Chriſt hath purchaſed unto us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Which generall rule of avoiding offence of them that are weak in faith, the Apoſtle doth apply in the words following, <hi>upon the meats</hi> which were fordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Law, but were indifferent things in the Goſpel. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing</hi> (no meat) <hi>unclean</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) <hi>of it ſelf; but to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> (common) From which he maketh a two-fold inference.</p>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:164278:31"/>I. <hi>He that hath the knowledge</hi> and receiveth it for a free indifferent thing, may uſe it for himſelf without ſinne: Yet ſo, that he give no offence towards ſinne, nor grieve or diſtract without neceſſity the weak, who doth not yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſame, but accounteth it for forbidden and unclean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 15, <hi>For if thy brother be grieved with thy meat</hi> (in his Conſcience) <hi>Now walkeſt thou not charitably. Deſtroy not him with thy meat, for whom Chriſt died.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>He that hath not the knowledge,</hi> but eſteemeth it to be forbidden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, or at leaſt doubteth thereof, may not uſe the ſame without ſinne and offence to his Conſcience, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>All things indeed are pure, but it is evill for that man who eateth with offence,</hi> v. 23. <hi>and he that doubteth</hi> (whether they are indifferent or not, lawfull or unlawfull before God) <hi>if he eateth is damned,</hi> (condemned) <hi>viz.</hi> of his own Conſcience, <hi>becauſe he eateth not of faith. For whatſoever is not of faith (viz.</hi> ſo that we are ſure that they are acceptable to God, or permitted by God) <hi>is ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>

Where he applieth it almoſt in like manner to meats offered to Idols, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eating of thoſe things that are offered in Sacrifice unto Idols, We know that an Idoll is nothing, &amp;c.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Howbeit, there is not in every man that knowledge; for ſome with Conſcience of the Idol, eat it as a thing offered unto an Idol, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience being weak, is defiled, &amp;c.</hi> v. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>Take heed, leſt by any means this liberty of yours become a ſtumbling block to them that are weak. For if any man ſeeth thee, which haſt knowledge, ſit at table in the Idols Temple, Shall not the Conſcience of him which is weak, be emboldned to eat thoſe things which are offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Idols? And through thy knowledge ſhall the weak brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died. But when you ſinne ſo againſt the brethren, and wound their weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ye ſinne againſt Chriſt. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh, while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which Doctrine of the Apoſtle, we may here eaſily underſtand, what, and how farre we ought to judge in matters of Religion and Conſcience: <hi>Judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in his brothers way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, I.<note place="margin">How farre we may judge of the Doctrine and Religion of the erring.</note> we muſt not judge the perſons whether they are damned before God or not, but properly and principally the matter it ſelf, whether it be an article of faith or life, of doctrine or worſhip, and only ſo farre and to this end, <hi>that it may not become a ſtumbling block and offence of Conſcience</hi> unto us and others: But the perſons we may judge ſo farre, that we may avoid to give them the like offence, or we our ſelves to be offended at them.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And not only in thoſe things, which are commanded or forbidden by God to beleeve or to do, and therefore are neceſſary; but, alſo which are in themſelves free <hi>indifferent things,</hi> which is to ſay, neither commanded nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and therefore not neceſſary to do or to omit them: which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we muſt judge thus far, leſt by our liberty we put a ſtumbling block in the way of the weak, whereby they might deal againſt their Conſcience, having no knowledge of ſuch liberty, but holding them for neceſſary in their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſcience, or doubting of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Being we muſt be ſo cautious in free indifferent things, becauſe of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:164278:32"/> weak; how much more in things that are neceſſary and <hi>commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by God,</hi> leſt we may teach or do ſomewhat againſt our knowledge, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, what God hath rejected and prohibited in his Word as unlawfull, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or omit what God hath ordained and commanded: Whereby we ſhould give yet a more dangerous offence, firſt to our own Conſcience, who have the knowledge thereof out of the Word of God, and then to others, whether they have the knowledge thereof or not, not only to do againſt erroneus or weak, but againſt true-beleeving Conſciences, and withall againſt Gods command it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. But moſt of all, when ſuch <hi>falſe Doctrine or Religion,</hi> which God hath forbidden, is preſſed upon us, not only as ſound and true, but as <hi>neceſſary unto ſalvation;</hi> or on the contrary, when <hi>the true ſound Doctrine and worſhip,</hi> which God hath commanded, is forbidden and condemned not only as unneceſſary or erroneous, but even <hi>as hereticall.</hi> Which alſo, if we did confeſſe or practice that, and did deny or omit this againſt Conſcience, would not only prove a common ſinne and offence to our and our neighbours Conſcience; but alſo idolatry and a denying of God.</p>
                  <p>For ſince we ought not to give way, that ſuch things which God in the Goſpel left free and indifferent unto us, (as for example the Moſaicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of meats, or the Circumciſion which was injoyned to the people of Iſrael in the Law,) ſhould be, as neceſſary, impoſed on us, leſt we might ſeek our ſalvation without Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. How much leſſe then ought we to countenance thoſe things which God hath abſolutely forbidden, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we would ſeek our ſalvation, not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>againſt Chriſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of mens Traditions and Doctrines make Gods commandement of none effect? <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <note place="margin">Whether and how farre we may ſeparate ourſelves in the doctrine and religion of the erroneous Church.</note>V. From whence we conclude further, when we becauſe of ſuch erroneous doctrine or Religion inforced upon us as neceſſary againſt the Word of God; as much as in our conſcience we may have knowledge of it, <hi>are cried downe for Hereticks, condemned,</hi> excommunicated, ſhut out and cut off from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church and the communion of the Saints; That then we have not only good reaſon, but alſo are in conſcience bound and conſtrained of neceſſity and force <hi>to ſeparate</hi> our ſelves and with-draw from that Church thus proceeding with us; And not conſequently thoſe, who of neceſſity as excommunicate and rejected men muſt ſeparate themſelves, but thoſe, which do reject and force them to ſuch a ſeparation, are properly guilty of the unjuſt, uncharitable judging of mens Conſciences, and alſo of the ſciſme and diviſion of all the miſeries and diſtractions depending from the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Yea that no man, who in his Conſcience acknowledgeth, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the truth of God, which by ſuch erroneous Churches or thoſe that have charge over them, is thus excommunicated and condemned, may with a ſafe Conſcience remaine in their <hi>outward communion</hi> and fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> becauſe he cannot but play the Hypocrite and diſſemble thereby <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own true beleeving Conſcience,</hi> and againſt the Word of God, ſo that he would become to himſelfe a heavie offence and ſtumbling blocke to his own conſcience.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:164278:32"/>
                  <p>Then, becauſe he would alſo by his example be ſcandalous and offenſive <hi>to other true beleevers,</hi> who together with him did acknowledge the ſame and were excommunicated for it; yea ſhould ſtrengthen and confirm their excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and condemnation as much as did lie in his power; which certainly is a moſt grievous ſinne not only againſt the confeſſion of faith, but againſt the Chriſtian brotherly charitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe he would alſo give an offence to the <hi>erring partie,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming him both in ſuch errours and in the uncharitable excommunication and condemnation with his own example, and aſſent and by making himſelf partaker of their ſinnes and perſecutions.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. <hi>Moreover,</hi> when ſuch Church or part of it, although it doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch erroneous doctrine and religion; yet inforceth it not upon 'its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-members, as neceſſary, nor excommunicateth or reiecteth them for it; but in ſuch erroneous points of doctrine permitteth the true-beleevers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy their <hi>liberty of conſcience;</hi> Theſe then, though they have reaſon to avoid and beware of the <hi>Communion of the erroneous doctrine and worſhip,</hi> as of an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and pernicious leaven, and to contradict it out of the word of God in due time and place, with Chriſtian charity and meekneſſe; yet in their other points of doctrine and Religion agreeable to the word of God; ought not as yet utterly to withdraw and ſeparate themſelves <hi>from ſuch a Church,</hi> leſt by their ſeparation an occaſion may be given to further ſciſme and diviſion; which many times is more prejudiciall and offenſive, then the errour it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Whereof we have ſet before our eyes not only the Prophets and other true-beleeving Iſraelites who lived in the idolatrous times at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and during the Baal-ſervice in Iſrael, and yet not bowed their knees unto him: But alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt himſelf and his Diſciples before and after his aſcenſion; who did not ſeparate themſelvs from the Jewiſh Temple and Synagogues (as long as they could be tolerated in them) becauſe of the leven of the Phariſees and Saduces; yea the Lord rather exhorted them, that though they ſhould <hi>take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the leven, Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 6. yet ſhould labour <hi>to do and to obſerve,</hi> whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſees did bid them obſerve <hi>in Moſes ſeat</hi> out of the law. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Out of all this we inferre yet further:<note place="margin">When and how farre we may undergo the Refoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> If not only private particular perſons, but <hi>whole Congregations,</hi> or the greateſt and principall part of them; eſpecially they that have charge over them; acknowledge and diſcover by the Word of God <hi>any dangerous errour and abuſe,</hi> which hath peradventure ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken root in them, Whereby <hi>ſomewhat that is erroneous and pernicious is added, or ſomewhat that is ſound and neceſſary is diminiſhed or perverted in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable ſaving doctrine and worſhip;</hi> That then they have good reaſon, yea, are bound in their Conſcience and function <hi>to reform</hi> ſuch dangerous abuſes and errours according to the Word of God and the example of the Primitive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Apoſtolicall Church; yea, withall to exhort and animate out of Gods Word other Congregations unto like Reformation, leſt they caſt any further ſtumbling block and occaſion to fall both in their own and their poſterities way, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>Joſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5.14, 15.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:164278:33"/>
                  <p>Yet ſo, that they do not therefore raſhly <hi>condemn other particular Churches,</hi> which do not acknowledge ſuch errours, but rather carefully endeavour to conſerve the bond of Chriſtian charity and unity in the reſt of the Univerſall undoubted Doctrine, till they are likewiſe edified by their example, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from ſuch dangerous errours.</p>
                  <p>But if other particular Churches are ſo much ſcandalized and offended at ſuch Reformation, that they cry down therefore the reformed Congregations for Hereticall, excommunicate, or violently perſecute them; Nevertheleſſe theſe ſaid reformed Churches, as long as they cannot legally and lawfully be convinced of any damnable errour out of the Word of God, but rather are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make good before any legall Eccleſiaſticall Convocation or Synod, that they have ſetled their Reformation according to the Word of God, upon very weighty and urgent motives, and to adhere cloſely and poſitively to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall undoubted Chriſtian Doctrine and Religion, are not only no wayes bound to ſhrink from and give over the Reformation of ſuch acknowledged errors and abuſes becauſe of the ſcandalizing &amp; offence of other particular Churches; which either ariſe from evill affections, or from an erroneous Conſcience: But alſo they are ſo much more obliged ſtedfaſtly to cleave and ſtick to it; being the reformed <hi>errours and abuſes</hi> are preſſed upon them not only as lawfull, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>as neceſſary points of ſaving Doctrine and Religion,</hi> whereby they become but a more dangerous and damnable ſtumbling block and offence both to them that acknowledge the errours, and to them that do not.</p>
                  <p>And ſo conſequently not thoſe Churches or Congregations which are <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> according to the Word of God, but thoſe that excommunicate and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne</hi> them therefore without and againſt the Word of God, will be guilty of the injuſt judging and of the ſchiſme or diviſion ariſing from it.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. And all this is done without leſſe difficulty and contention; If in ſuch reformed Congregations <hi>thoſe to whoſe charge they are committed,</hi> whether they be Secular or Eccleſiaſticall, <hi>with the Congregation,</hi> or the greater and principall part of it, <hi>agree and conſent unto ſuch reformation according to the Word of God.</hi> As it hath been practiſed in the times of the Kings, <hi>Aſa, Joſaphat, Hiſhia, Joſia,</hi> and times of our Forefathers in the moſt Proteſtant Evangelicall Churches in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, England, Denmarke, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the difficulty is ſo much greater, when <hi>thoſe that have charge over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> eſpecially the temporall <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> as <hi>Patrons</hi> of the Churches <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree</hi> and <hi>diſſent in the Reformation</hi> from their ſubjects, or from the greater part of them, (As commonly elſe it happeneth <hi>when the greater part of the Citizens and Commons</hi> in any City or Province diſſent from the other) wherein even the wiſeſt and moſt religious men may peradventure ſlide and ſtumble, being either defective or exceſſive in it, when they <hi>walk not uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel,</hi> or ſometimes out of zeal towards truth, <hi>forget Chriſtian charity and peaceableneſſe,</hi> and whileſt they labour to avoid the one, cauſe oftentimes another offence which is farre greater. As we have an example propounded unto us in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, who by his diſſembling with the Jewiſh Ceremonies, fearing them that were of the Circumciſion and weak in faith, would have carried away and given a more dangerous offence to the beleevers
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:164278:33"/> among the Gentiles, unleſſe he had been rebuked and withſtood by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>But that we in ſuch caſes according to the Apoſtles rule, as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may avoid to ſcandalize and offend the conſciences;<note place="margin">Wherein we muſt be eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially cautious in reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we muſt firſt of all exactly examine <hi>the errour and abuſe,</hi> which we intend to reform, whether it doth ſo certainly and infallibly appear by the Word of God, and beſides, <hi>ſo prejudiciall and dangerous,</hi> that of neceſſity it requireth a publike Reformation, and may not be tolerated without a grievous offence and ſtumbling block to the Conſcience; leſt we, deſiring to bring in preſently a publike Reformation, and as it were, <hi>an alteration of Religion</hi> at every pretended errour and abuſe, which yet is doubtfull, or could be remedied with more moderation and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or might be tolerated without prejudice to the ſoule, may thereby be an occaſion of a greater offence then the errour it ſelf; being the alterations and mutations are not leſſe; yea, oftentimes a great deal more dangerous in matters of Religion and Church-government, then in all other temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; And then by reaſon of humane infirmity we cannot expect and look for ſuch a perfection in the Church-militant here on earth, whereby it might be exempted from all defects, errours and abuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> though the errour and abuſe is ſo prejudiciall and dangerous, that a publike Reformation in Doctrine and Religion ſhould be requiſite: Yet we muſt by all means beware of an exteriour <hi>violent compulſion,</hi> except it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch horrid and hideous kind of blaſphemies and inſurrection, as we mentioned heretofore; where it doth manifeſtly appear, that they do proceed rather from an <hi>obſtinate malice of the heart, then weakneſſe and ignorance of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding;</hi> Or except we had ſuch an expreſſe warrant and inſtruction, with ſuch a Propheticall zealous ſpirit as <hi>Elias:</hi> For otherwiſe all violent compulſion in matters of Faith and Conſcience is abſolutely repugnant <hi>to the Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who requireth from his people <hi>a willing, chearfull, ſincere,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Why all exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour violent compulſion is to be avoided.</note> 
                     <hi>faithfull,</hi> but <hi>not a forced hypocriticall, unbeleeving obedience.</hi> It is alſo impoſſible to undergo ſuch violent compulſion without a grievous <hi>offence and ſcandall of Conſcience:</hi> For whatſoever is done of force againſt Conſcience, is not of Faith, but againſt Faith, and conſequently cannot be but ſinfull and damnable, both to him that is compelled, and to him that compelleth; although the work elſe is good, commendable and right in it ſelf, which the erring party againſt its Conſcience is compelled unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 23. Neither can ſuch compulſion of conſciences procure any true, Chriſtian, ſound reformation and edification of the Church; but rather in ſtead of the intended edification, ſhall cauſe a moſt pernicious ſchiſme or diviſion, yea oftentimes a <hi>totall ruine and deſtruction of the Church;</hi> as we have at theſe preſent times in ſeverall places many wofull exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſet before our eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we muſt likewiſe take heed <hi>of an uncharitable condemning and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi> the erring party; And although the errour and abuſe were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely damnable in it ſelf, yet we ought not, and cannot raſhly condemn the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Firſt, becauſe we ought alwayes to preſume out of Chriſtian charity, that they do erre only out of weakneſſe, as long as they may under any pretenſe clear themſelves from an obſtinate malice. Secondly, becauſe it is expedient for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:164278:34"/> us to labour to over-ſway rather the malice by meekneſſe, and hope that they at length may be won and converted by Gods mercy and goodneſſe, whereof we will ſpeak more at large hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in the fourth place it is moſt certain, that during ſuch diſſention of a ſtrong party of the common people in any City or Province <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Reformation</hi> may not eaſily be undertaken by the true-beleeving party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it can hardly or never take any effect without exteriour force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of the erring party: And in caſe the erring party retaineth ſtill, if not all, yet the moſt principall and neceſſary articles of ſaving fundamentall Doctrine, ſo that they cannot directly be accounted unfaithfull Heathens or damned Hereticks; but held yet for weak beleevers and erring Chriſtians; then the ſaid Reformation ought by no means to be put on againſt their will, before they are bitter informed; eſpecially the errours being ſuch, which have not been rejected or condemned by the Word of God in the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe, leſt the true beleevers out of want of an univerſal Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be ſcandalized and offended in their own Conſcience; They have good reaſon, yea, are bound for their part to avoid the <hi>communion of ſuch acknowledged dangerous errours and abuſes;</hi> yet in ſuch a manner, that they do not directly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves in the remainder of the true doctrine and worſhip from the erring Congregation, as long as they may be tolerated in it, but rather for the avoiding of the Schiſme or Diviſion of the Church, be carefull to maintain the bond of Chriſtian charity and unity, till God may open the eyes of the erring party to acknowledge their errours.</p>
                  <p>But when the true-beleevers themſelves are not tolerated by the erring par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as it happeneth oftentimes) but excommunicated or condemned becauſe of the rejecting of their errours: Then they have not only very good reaſon, but in ſome regard are compelled to ſettle ſeparately their Aſſembly and Religion, and conſequently <hi>a particular Reformation,</hi> becauſe they are not obliged quite to omit and ſet the exerciſe of Religion aſide for the erring parties ſake; which they exclude from their Congregations, if not from the hearing of Gods word, yet from the uſe and communion of the holy Sacraments. Where again, not thoſe that are of neceſſity compelled to ſeparate themſelves, but theſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,<note place="margin">Whether, and how farre the Magiſtrates may undertake the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without the conſent of the ſubjects.</note> and excommunicate thoſe, are guilty of this Schiſme.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially the Chriſtian <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> may no wayes be reſtrained or blamed, if they acknowledging by the Word of God ſuch like errours and abuſes, though their ſubjects will not hearken to any Reformation; yet at leaſt do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſaid errours <hi>for their families and fellow-beleevers,</hi> without compulſion of the others: Like as <hi>Joſhua</hi> denounced to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though they ſhould forſake the Lord to ſerve other gods; yet he and his houſe would ſerve him, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 24. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. And like as ſome godly Kings in <hi>Juda,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though they could not reſtrain the people from ſacrificing in high places; yet they for their own perſons, with thoſe that followed them, walked upright in the eyes of the Lord, not departing and turning aſide from his Houſe and Ordinances, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 22. <hi>verſ.</hi> 43, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 33.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:164278:34"/>
                  <p>For if it doth not ſtand with reaſon and equity, that the Magiſtrates ſhould compell the true-beleeving or erring ſubjects againſt their Conſcience; How much more unreaſonable and unjuſt would it then be; that ſubjects,<note n="*" place="margin">The Author in this place ſpeaketh of the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbougs</hi> caſe with his Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran ſubjects who endeavor to ſtop him &amp; his reformed attendants from the free exerciſe of Religion.</note> though true-beleevers, ſhould ſtop and reſtrain the Magiſtrates and their dependents from their liberty of Conſcience and publike exerciſe of Religion, which they under their protection, and in their errours enjoy?</p>
                  <p>And all this is chiefly to be obſerved in ſuch difference and diſſention of the Church w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concern <hi>partly the fundamental doctrin it ſelf.</hi> But the condemning and ſeparation is ſo much more to be taken heed of, when the difference and diſpute ariſeth not from any one point of the fundamentall Doctrine, or from any Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition in Religion, but only from the by-points in Doctrine or Ceremonies; though the errours and abuſes in them ought to be avoided as much as is poſſible, leſt a little leaven may at length leaven the whole lump.</p>
                  <p>Where it may come to paſſe, that the erring which in their errour neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conſerve the bond of charity in unity, are not only tolerated as brethren, but alſo accounted for better Chriſtians then thoſe who, though they do not erre in the controverted Doctrine, yet procure thereby a Schiſme and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by reaſon of their unſeaſonable judging and condemning, who although they keep on both ſides the grounds of Faith, yet overthrow therwith the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſtian love which is moſt of all requiſite.</p>
                  <p>Whereof we read in the Ancient Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories about the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt 250. a very memorable example of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his followers on one ſide, and of <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his dependents on the other ſide. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, though <hi>Cyprian,</hi> together with the Biſhops in <hi>Africa,</hi> erred in his opinion, that the Hereticks being converted ſhould be re-baptized; Yet, becauſe he did not by ſuch erroneous opinion of his condemn others, who defended the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but inviolably maintained the bond of Chriſtian unity; (<hi>Servatur à nobis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienter &amp; firmiter charitas animi, collegii honor, vinculum fidei &amp; concordia ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii.</hi> Epiſt. 73.) He was therefore much leſſe to be blamed then <hi>Stephen,</hi> who, though he did not erre in the Doctrine, yet condemned <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the others for it, was by the Biſhops ſharply reproved for ſuch unchriſtian judging and unneceſſary ſeparation.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt all Schiſmes and Diviſions in Churches, which ever ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times aroſe amongſt the Chriſtians; we ſhall hardly find any one which hath been fomented with more vehemency and fierceneſſe, then that which in our Predeceſſours dayes ſprung originally in <hi>Germany,</hi> and afterwards was ſpread over all <hi>Europe,</hi> and at this preſent is divulged, (witneſſe our own eyes) to a moſt lamentable deſolation and deſtruction of Chriſtendom, ſo that ſome long continuance thereof, which is feared, will draw at length upon the necks of all Weſtern Churches like puniſhment and oppreſſions, as formerly the Eaſtern ſuffered under the Turks, Tartars and other Barbarous Nations, unleſſe the Lord doth ſhorten and prevent them by the day of his apparition. Wherefore every one hath good reaſon to be carefull and to ſearch out which ſide properly is guilty, and the cauſe of ſuch pernicious Schiſmes, that we may know to which to give aſſent, and to which not. Whereby it is not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one ſide ſhould be only and totally guilty, and the other abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and guiltleſſe. For it may well be, that there hath been faults on both ſides, either in the exceſſe, or defect; whereby their minds were exaſperated, and the diviſions grown to ſuch a high pitch. And the differences and diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in Churches, are much like the warre or judiciall law-buſineſſe; where many times the moſt juſt and equitable cauſe is very ill managed, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:164278:35"/> prolonged and extended to a great inconvenience, if not to the utmoſt ruine of both diſagreeing parties. But, ſince indifferences in Religion, eſpecially when a reſolute Schiſme and Diviſion is already formed in the Church, no <hi>Neutrality,</hi> nor therefore a totall ſeparation from the Chriſtian Church, or the ſettlement of a peculiar Church is admitted; but aſſent is to be given either to one or the other ſide in the ſaving Doctrine and Religion, though not all its actions may be approved; At leaſt thus far muſt be determined of the guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and innocency of the different parties, to the end that men may know which Church is to be imbraced, and which not.</p>
                  <p>Which ſubject fully and punctually to handle and maintain would require a peculiar book, in regard that all modern writings, whether they concern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Diſſenſions, or Eccleſiaſticall Unity, are in ſome kind directed to this ſcope. But we ſhall here be conſtrained only to touch it in a ſhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way, as much as will conduce to our preſent intention, and to declare it briefly by the aforementioned principles. And firſt, whether, and how farre we have reaſon to judge their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to ſeparate our ſelves from them, or to reform them. Then ſecondly, whether therefore by any means we ought to judge and condemn <hi>the perſons</hi> or whole Churches.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Where then firſt it is to be exactly examined,<note place="margin">How farre the Proteſtants are ſeparated from the Romiſh Church.</note> 
                     <hi>how farre the Proteſtant Churches have ſeparated themſelves from the Roman-Catholicks;</hi> Seeing they have not withdrawn themſelves one from another in al points of Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion, but remain ſtill united in many great and weighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which have been unanimouſly acknowledged of both ſides out of the Word of God. For both ſides profeſſe and receive the whole Vniverſall <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall Creed,</hi> whereunto we are Baptized on all ſides. Likewiſe both ſides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>the ten Commandements and the Prayer of the Lord:</hi> And although they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in their Catechiſmes the ſecond Commandement concerning Images; yet they retain it at leaſt in their Bibles; ſo that we remain undivided at leaſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter in three moſt neceſſary Symboles or Articles of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Chriſtian Religion, <hi>credendorum, faciendorum, petendorum,</hi> what is neceſſary <hi>to beleeve, to do,</hi> and <hi>to aske,</hi> as was mentioned heretofore. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they have added many other human Ceremonies and Traditions, to the holy Sacraments which Chriſt himſelf hath inſtituted; yet we acknowledge that they have thus farre kept <hi>the true Baptiſme,</hi> being the moſt neceſſary Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that we nor they deſire to rebaptize thoſe that were baptized by us and them. Moreover, they receive and acknowledge with us the whole <hi>Sacred Scripture of the Old and New Teſtament,</hi> to be the indubitable Word of God, whoſe Interpretation and meaning in many ſound Doctrines, yea, I dare ſay in the moſt, is unqeſtioned betwixt us and them. Yea likewiſe in <hi>the Symbols of the Primitive Church of the firſt</hi> and principall Councels, which we receive on both ſides agreeable and warrantable by Scripture: and finally, in all points of their Doctrine and Religion, which are true, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted, Ancient, Catholick,</hi> we remain as yet united with them againſt all other erroneous Sectaries, as hath been declared before: Wherefore we cannot, nor will judge them Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but rather we muſt judge and determine by thoſe undoubted and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable grounds of both ſides, all other differences in Doctrine that are left:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:164278:36"/> And if we only might be tolerated by them without compulſion of Conſcience; we, nor they had then no cauſe to ſeparate and with-draw our ſelves one from another; And we would ſufficiently find in the ſaid articles whatſoever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II.

                  <p>But in ſuch things, which <hi>We for our part</hi> account <hi>for free indifferent matters;</hi> but they <hi>for neceſſary,</hi> either out of cuſtome, or becauſe of the Tradition of their Church, or out of a miſ-apprehenſion of the Word of God (as for example in Faſts and Holy daies) we ought to judge the matter thus far, leſt according to the rule of the Apoſtle, we may caſt a ſtumbling block or ſcandall before them by our liberty and knowledge in their pretended neceſſity; but rather diſpenſe with our exteriour liberty in ſuch indifferent things, becauſe of them that are weak in faith: If but they reciprocally permit us the liberty of Conſcience, that we are not conſtrained to receive &amp; acknowledg them as neceſſary unto ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>As alſo contrariwiſe in thoſe things, which <hi>We for our part</hi> eſteem <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe of Gods Ordinance, but they as <hi>free indifferent things</hi> (as for example the Communion under both kinds) We muſt then judge their erroneous opinion thus farre, leſt we omit and neglect Gods Ordinance againſt our Conſcience for their ſake. Yet nevertheleſſe, as long as they do not yet acknowledge with us ſuch neceſſity and Ordinance of God; We have no reaſon therefore to judge their Conſciences, nor to ſeparate our ſelves from them in all other points of Doctrine and Religion, wherein we agree as yet together; If they would but let us enjoy our liberty therein, leſt we ſhould be conſtrained to do againſt our Conſciences becauſe of their pretended liberty.</p>
                  <p n="3">III.

                  <p>Yet if they would not preſſe ſuch Doctrine and worſhip of theirs which they for themſelves hold neceſſary, as neceſſary upon us againſt our Conſciences, who know it to be repugnant to the word of God; but at leaſt would tolerate us amongſt themſelves as erring and weake beleeving Chriſtians; If alſo their Religion and worſhip were ſo conſtituted that we could have a fellowſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the other points, wherein we yet agree, <hi>without communion of any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,</hi> and without hypocriſie <hi>or denying of Gods truth</hi> and without <hi>ſcandall to

                  <p>But now at this preſent the difference and breach betwixt the Romiſh and Proteſtant Church is in a quite other caſe,<note place="margin">Why we muſt of neceſſity ſeparate our ſelves from the Romiſh Church.</note> ſo that the Schiſm and Separation is unavoidable, eſpecially for theſe reaſons following:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe the Romiſh Church beſides the Doctrine which on both ſides is received <hi>for Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Catholike,</hi> will not let the Proteſtants enjoy their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in many ſuch Doctrines and forms of worſhip, whereof they themſelves muſt confeſſe, <hi>that they are not neceſſary in themſelves unto ſalvation;</hi> but inforce thoſe upon them as <hi>abſolutely neceſſary becauſe of their Traditions and Ordinances of the Church, ſub anathemate,</hi> upon excommunication and pain of damnation: And even in ſuch things, which we for our part hold not only not neceſſary, but <hi>expreſſely repugnant to the Word of God,</hi> and partly <hi>Superſtitious:</hi> As for example: The Communion under one kind contrary to the commandement of Chriſt: <hi>Drink ye all of this:</hi> The Invocation of Saints, and adoration of Images repugnant to the Commandement: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf Images, Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them, &amp;c.</hi> The prohibition for all Prieſts to marry, and commandment for all Chriſtians to abſtain from certain meats at certain times; which the Apoſtle calleth <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and more ſuch like points, which for the moſt part were ſpecified before in the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe they have introduced ſome ſuch Doctrines and Religion <hi>as neceſſary fundamentall Doctrines,</hi> whereas they cannot ſhew us any evident and certain warrant from the written Word of God, that they are of God; but we may produce to the contrary more certain and manifeſt grounds from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted written Word of God, being convinced in our Conſciences, that they are <hi>falſe, erroneous,</hi> and repugnant to Gods Word and Ordinance, or to the very fundamentall Doctrine, if not expreſſely, yet by a neceſſary conſequence: and alſo abſolutely <hi>damnable</hi> in themſelves, eſpecially to them who ſhould entertain them againſt their Conſciences: For example, That the body of Chriſt muſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be formed of bread by the Maſſe-Prieſt, or tranſubſtantiated, offered again for the quick and dead, and adored under the ſhape of bread: That we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve eternal life through our own condign merits, make ſatisfaction for our ſins we our ſelves, and yet even be doubtfull of our ſalvation: That all men on earth are ſubject to the Pope in ſtead of Chriſt upon pain of their damnation, and muſt beleeve and receive as the words of Chriſt himſelf, whatſoever he teacheth and ordaineth by vertue of his Supreme Popiſh power, And ſuch like points, which they for their part maintain not only as neceſſary and ſound Doctrines, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:164278:37"/> them upon the whole Chriſtian Church, as principall points of moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fundamentall ſaving Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe their chief and daily Religion and worſhip is ſo qualified, that we cannot even have a communion with that which they retain with us out of the Word of God, unleſſe we would thereby againſt our conſciences make our ſelves partakers of ſuch erroneous Doctrines and Superſtitious abuſes eſpecially <hi>in the Maſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and principally, becauſe they will not tolerate us, who cannot allow againſt our Conſciences and the known Word of God, of their un-Catholick by-Doctrines and Ceremonies, which they have added to the Ancient Catholick Doctrines, nor receive us either as true-beleevers, nor as erring, weak, beleeving fellow members of the Chriſtian Church, but utterly <hi>condemn and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate us as unfaithfull Hereticks;</hi> yea, in many places <hi>perſecute us</hi> with baniſhment, fire and ſword, as it is apparently manifeſt to the whole world; ſo that they have ſolemnly publiſhed and authorized their un-Chriſtian ſentence in <hi>the Councell of Trent,</hi> in ſuch a manner that it cannot be recalled, and conſequently no meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration or reconcilement and agreement on their ſide can be hoped for, as long as they ſtand to the ſaid Councell.</p>
                  <p>By all which I conceive each impartial and unpaſſionate man may eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,<note place="margin">How farre we judge the Papiſts.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> that we for our part, not only ought, but are bound in conſcience <hi>to judge</hi> and determine thus far of their Doctrine and Religion, yet not with the intent that we ſhould attribute unto our ſelves or to our Churches <hi>any juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or power</hi> over other Churches or perſons and their Conſciences, or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>our own ſpirit to be judge in matters of Religion,</hi> as the Papiſts do charge us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; or that every Idiot or Ignorant may and can judge of Theologicall Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies: But only that we, each of us <hi>for himſelf and his own Conſcience,</hi> muſt judge and diſcern <hi>Judicio diſcretionis,</hi> (as far as God through his ſpirit hath endued him with knowledge of his word) what we apprehend to be conſonant or repugnant to the Word of God, truth or falſhood, good or evill, light or darkneſſe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently what <hi>(for to avoid our own damnation)</hi> we beleeve for our ſelves or not beleeve, confeſſe or deny, or alſo ſet by as uncertain and doubtfull, and in one word <hi>what we muſt do and avoid for our ſalvation.</hi> Which judging and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no man, let him be never ſo ſimple and unlearned, and of what Religion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:164278:37"/>
                  <p>Yea, that <hi>We</hi> are not thoſe, who ſeparate and with-draw our ſelves from the Catholick Church, but the Papiſts are they, who firſt by un-Catholick additions of new Doctrins and Traditions are <hi>fallen away from the true Ancient Catholick A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall Church,</hi> and withall <hi>reject and ſeparate</hi> themſelves from us by their un-Chriſtian condemning and perſecuting us as Hereticks; And not only us, but <hi>all other Churches of the whole world,</hi> which are not ſubjected to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz. the Grecian, Ruſſian, Armenian, Georgian, Aethiopian, &amp;c. wherby nevertheleſſe the Romiſh Church, by pretending to be the Univerſal <hi>Catholick Church</hi> on earth, and excluding all others from it, hath ſeparated it ſelf from all other Churches in the whole world (like as in fromer times the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>) and is alſo become a right <hi>Schiſmaticall Sectary Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore alſo we muſt of neceſſity ſeparate our ſelves from it, both for its <hi>un-Catholicall ſuperſtitious Doctrine and Religion,</hi> leſt we make our ſelves parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of it, and alſo for its <hi>un-Chriſtian Tyrannical judging,</hi> becauſe we may not be tolerated amongſt them, but are utterly rejected by them; to the end that we may remain united with the true Catholick Church in the Univerall Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith and brotherly charity in Chriſt.</p>

How much more then when it is ſufficiently and evidently warranted and convinced by the Word of God? Then ſecondly, <hi>the Conſciences of our brethren,</hi> who acknowledge with us ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and abuſes of the Popiſh Doctrine and Religion, to whom we ſhould give a very grievous offence, if we diſſembling againſt Conſcience would alſo by our example miſ-lead them againſt Conſcience to the like hypocriſie and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, <hi>the Conſciences of the erring themſelves,</hi> who do not acknowledge the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> errours as yet, and whom we would by our example confirm in their Idolatry and abuſes, and conſequently in their uncharitable excommunications and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of the true beleevers, and therewith make our ſelves partakers of their ſins, whereas we ſhould rather labour to bring them to knowledge, as much as lies in our power. And although we upon theſe moſt urgent and ſolid reaſons muſt be ſeparate from the Romiſh Church in the Communion of their exterior Congregations; Yet we are inſeparate and undivided in thoſe things wherein they agree with us in the Primitive Apoſtolicall Chriſtianity, as hath been ſaid heretofore; and remain with them as far united both in the Doctrin of faith and in the duties of Chriſtian charity, as much as we with ſafety of our Conſciences may diſcharge towards them, or they will but accept of us.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe not onely particular men and teachers, but alſo whole Congregations, yea, whole people and nations unanimouſly agree in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and rejecting of ſuch erroneous Popiſh Doctrin and Worſhip:<note place="margin">That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches had good reaſon, &amp; have been bound in Conſcience to reforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> It doth follow by all this without any contradiction, that they <hi>have had good reaſon, yea have been bound in Conſcience and by vertue of their Function</hi> to purge their Churches from ſuch Popiſh leaven, and to <hi>reform</hi> them according to the word of God; (though the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Romiſh Church with their Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents will not condeſcend at all to ſuch Reformation, but Anathematize, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, oppoſe and deſtroy it to their utmoſt power;) ſeeing it cannot be maintained under any pretence or warrant from the word of God, that all other Churches and Nations of the whole world, neceſſarily ſhould be ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the <hi>Italian</hi> or Romiſh Church; inſomuch that they muſt be tyed to thoſe palpable abuſes they have introduced, nor dare alter or remove them: Whereas yet much more in each particular Church; aſwell they that have the charge over it, whether they be Eccleſiaſticall or Temporall, as the whole Congregation, is obliged in its Authoritie and Dutie and by Gods precept, to purge themſelves from all pernicious leaven in Doctrine, practiſe and worſhip, and to conforme themſelves, as much as is poſſible to the word of God, the Doctrine and example of the Primitive Apoſtolicall Church. Whereunto they are alſo every where moſt earneſtly admoniſhed as well from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whoſe reproving and warning Sermons are mearly altogether directed to this end, as from the Apoſtles, who labour to anticipate and prevent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the future calamities and miſeries, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10. &amp; 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. &amp; 5. <hi>v.</hi> 1.7.9.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 2.15. &amp; 3. <hi>v.</hi> 2. &amp; 4. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8.16.18.20.22, 23. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.14, 15, 16.20. &amp; 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. For as every Chriſtian is obliged to clenſe and purge his own Conſcience, from all pollution of ſinfull Doctrine and life, and needeth not to expect any other mans conſent in that which God hath commanded: Alſo every congregation ought, and is bound to purge and reforme it ſelfe according to the word of God, as much as is poſſible from all pollution and ſcandall in Doctrine, Life, and Worſhip, in ſpight of the whole world. But that Church, which reſiſteth ſuch Reformation with a violent power and force, diſcovereth it ſelfe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly thereby, to be herein not a true-Chriſtian, but rather Anti-chriſtian Church.<note place="margin">Although the Reformation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches is not blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yet it may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be rejected and diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note>

                  <p>Moreover, though the Reformation may be culpable, either in the manner or in ſome circumſtances; yet the maine worke in it ſelfe, being grounded upon the Word and Ordinances of God cannot be found fault withall.

                  <p>We cannot approve it, that the Reformation in ſome places was begun with a Tumult and Inſurrection of the vulgar people, by demoliſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of Images, Altars and Monaſteries, and ſuch other violent proceedings: Much leſſe, that Armes were taken up againſt Legall Magiſtrats, with the intent to Reforme withall.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we excuſe that the Laity under colour of Reformation, hath ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,

                  <p>Nor can we deny but that in the Church-government, ſince that it is devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Biſhops for the moſt part to Lay-men, in many places great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects occurre, <hi>in the diſpoſition and Adminiſtration of Eccleſiaſticall Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>

                  <p>Wee complaine alſo oftentimes, that the wholeſome <hi>Church-diſcipline</hi> of the Church is quite gone down and decayed, and wiſh nothing more but that it might flouriſh and revive againe after the example of the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe we hartily deſire, that in ſtead of the Reformation and removall of Popiſh abuſes in Faſts, Confeſſions, Vows, &amp;c. The true Chriſtian <hi>Fasting, with other practices of repentance and devotion,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine of the Catechiſme</hi> might be more diligently and earneſtly performed, both for the Inſtruction of the Youth, and the Idiots, and Ignorants in Bouroughs and villages.</p>

                  <p>WHat hath beene ſaid in the precedent Chapter of the Romiſh Church; That wee may likewiſe apply to the doctrine and worſhip which is controverted and diſputed, though in fewer points, betwixt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and other reformed Churches. Where we firſt willingly confeſſe and give thankes to God, that as wee differ in fewer Articles; yea fully agree in the moſt of them againſt the Papiſts and other Sectaries; we have alſo much leſſe reaſon to judge the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or to ſeparate, and with-draw our ſelves from them, then from the Papiſts, becauſe of ſuch differences which are rather fomented by ſome contentious Divines then by the Church it ſelfe.</p>

                     </note>For though we cannot but judge in our Conſcience ſome points of their doctrine and Ceremonies to be ereoneous and falſe, and if not directly, yet by a neceſſary conſequence repugnant to the word of God, and ſome Articles of faith; Nevertheleſſe, if but they, who have not the knowledge yet of ſuch conſequence, account their owne opinions agreeable to Scripture, might not impoſe them or theirs as neceſſary Articles of faith, but let us enjoy therein our liberty of Conſcience; If they alſo would leave to our freedome ſuch Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of theirs, as they themſelves will have held as free indifferent things, and conſequently would tolerate and receive us and our teachers as true Chriſtians, or at leaſt as weake brethren in faith, though we cannot aſſent to their owne peculiar opinions (as ſome peaceable Divines amongſt them <hi>Paulus Eberus, David Chytraeus, Christopherus Donaver. Nicolaus Hemmingius,</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally <hi>Philippus Melanchton,</hi> beſides many others of his Followers; yea whole Congregations and Churches, eſpecially in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> a great while ſince have declared themſelves.) Wee ſhould then have no reaſon at all, yea we were rather to be blamed and ſhould be Schiſmaticks indeed; if we of our owne accord ſhould with-draw and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:164278:39"/> ſeparate our ſelves from them, becauſe of ſuch different opinions and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Of whom we yet acknowledge, and confeſſe, that, for the reſt, if they doe not make their owne opinions to be neceſſary fundamentall points, they retaine with us the true ground of Chriſts ſaving Doctrine, and are exempted in their Religion from a publick and manifeſt Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe reaſons have our Churches and Divines at all times moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, earneſtly and zealouſly ſought to procure and ſettle a Chriſtian reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Unitie, as formerly in <hi>Luthers</hi> time in the conference at <hi>Marpurg, An.</hi> 1529, in the <hi>Concordia</hi> at <hi>Wittenberg, Anno</hi> 1536. and in later years the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and others in their Declarations for Eccleſiaſticall peace, which alſo were reaſſumed in the Conference at <hi>Leiprig, Anno</hi> 1631. As likewiſe at thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times many eminent Divines beyond Sea in <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (whoſe opinions and aſſiſtance therein, as that Reverend and worthy man Mr. <hi>Iohn Duray</hi> hath ſolicited with a ſingular induſtry and zeale to a peaceable Unitie and Reconcilement) faithfully and ſincerely wiſh &amp; adviſe in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writings ſuch an Unanimitie &amp; Uniformitie amongſt the Churches in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Whence it ſufficiently appeareth, that we for our part are not inclined to judge and to condemne the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or to continue in the diviſion and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from them, which hath laſted already above a hundred years.</p>
                  <p>Againe, it is knowne and manifeſt on the other ſide that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> on their part, will hearken and condeſcend not only to no abſolute agreement and reconcilement, but alſo to no Chriſtian and brotherly toleration or moderation in this unhappy Eccleſiaſticall difference: Becauſe the greater part of their Doctors and Divines, upom whom alſo many Lay-men depend, eſpecially the vulgar ſort (though with indiſcretion) and defend their zeale, maintain their different and controverted opinions, not only as agreeable with Scripture; but impoſe them alſo as neceſſary grounds and principall Articles of Chriſtian faith, without which men may not be counted true Chriſtians, nor be ſaved; And ſo in ſome manner falſifie therwith the <hi>ground-work it ſelf by their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall opinions,</hi> which they lay for a By-ground of ſalvation: And will not let us effectually injoy our Liberty in ſuch ceremonies, which they themſelves call <hi>adiaphora</hi> free indifferent things, nor conſequently receive us or our teachers as fellow-Chriſtians, unleſſe wee acknowledge and profeſſe with them the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſence of Chriſts body, the carnall eating thereof in the bread, and other ſuch like points of doctrine contained in their <hi>formula concordiae;</hi> much leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to the Miniſtery, but moſt vehemently condemne us as the worſt Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <hi>who doe ovorthrow the foundation,</hi> and exclude us from the Communion of their Churches, yea in many places exclude us from civill ſociety, from digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices, from Senates, from priviledges of the Citie, from marriages, and from honourable burials.</p>
                  <p>Moreover they yet daily and moſt ſpightfully pervert, calumniate and ſlander the Doctrine of our Church, and continually and moſt unjuſtly without the leaſt ground againſt our owne ſo often reiterated Declarations, charge it with dreadfull and abominable Blaſphemies, which neither <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe

                  <p>For where the whole congregation acknowledgeth with one conſent the errour and abuſe of the Lutheran Doctrine and Ceremonies in the different and controverted points; There no fault can be found with its unanimous and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Reformation. Wherein it may not be hindred, though ſome few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men diſſent from the whole Congregation, and had rather adhere to their <hi>Lutheran</hi> Opinion, in regard they have the liberty of their Conſcience no waies reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>But where <hi>the Congregation in any City or Province diſagreeth,</hi> ſo that a great part of it doth not onely not acknowledge the errour, but adhere ſo cloſly to their <hi>Lutheran</hi> opinions concerning Oral manducation and omni-preſence of Chriſts body, Exorciſme, Images, Hoſties and ſuch like things, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore condemne as Hereticks the other partie which will not allow of them: There theſe, ſince they of neceſſity muſt Separate themſelves from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners, are forced alſo to a <hi>particular Reformation</hi> of their religion; to the end that they for their part might diſcharge it towards God according to his Word and Ordinance with a ſafe conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially when the <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</hi> whom the worke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after the example of Kings, <hi>Aſae, Joſaphat, Hiskia, Joſia,</hi> chiefly dependeth upon, giveth aſſent to the true-beleeving partie. Wherein neither they may be reſtrained by any <hi>Temporall Conſtitution or Ordinance of their Predeceſſours,</hi> who have no dominion over the Conſciences of their Poſterity, nor can tye them to any erroneous Doctrine and Religion; which is undeniable amongſt Chriſtians on all ſides, who do not ground or build their Religion upon Temporall Ordinances, like the Heathen and Mahumetans, but relie only upon the word of God.</p>
                  <p>And although ſuch Reformation moſt commonly cannot be ſettled without greatly offending the erring partie: Yet a more ſpeciall care is to be taken of ſcandalizing firſt their owne Conſcience, then the Conſcience of other true-beleevers, and laſtly the Conſcience of the erring, leaſt they may be confirmed in their errours, then of offending and ſcandalizing the affections of the erring, whereby others are carried away with zeale to their errours, though with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:164278:41"/> Which zeale nevertheleſſe, I hope, ſhall never prevaile ſo far with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that they againſt their legall Magiſtrats, who have given them the libertie of their Conſcience and Religion without any impediment, ſhould therefore tumultuouſly riſe, when they maintaine and uſe the like libertie for themſelves, and them that are of the ſame confeſſion and Faith; Being the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines and confeſſours have hitherto not as yet attributed to themſelves the power, and as I hope will never do it, to abſolve and diſcharge the Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance towards the Magiſtrats, who have renounced the Obedience of the Popiſh See and Supremacy, as is ſufficiently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the examples in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides it would be thought in it ſelfe an unheard of injuſtice, if Subjects ſhould not ſuffer their Magiſtrats to have as much liberty of conſcience and Religion as they themſelves enjoy under their protection.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe if the Chriſtian Magiſtrats might but ſo much obtaine of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divines and Congregations of their Juriſdiction, that they might not <hi>calumniate</hi> or <hi>condemne</hi> the Doctrine of our Church; but receive us alſo as <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-brethren</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in our Faith and Confeſſion, unto the Miniſtery of the Word of God and uſe of the Holy Sacraments in their Aſſemblies: I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly then confeſſe, that men ſhould not raſhly undertake ſuch a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in Ceremonies, whereby a Diviſion may be occaſioned; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tolerate ſuch defects, becauſe of the Ignorant and weake in Faith, who do little apprehend and diſcerne the Diſcrepancy of the Doctrine, and <hi>at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Ceremonies</hi> preſently imagine a quite <hi>new Religion,</hi> whereas they ſhould inſiſt upon the found information of Doctrine, till they at length with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence and diviſion, either might be corrected with an unanimous goodly conſent, or each one enjoy his owne libertie therein.

                     <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Whether or how far we may judge or condemn the perſons in matters of Religion.</head>
                  <p>BY all this, what hitherto hath been declared of judging the matter it ſelf in different and controverted Doctrine and Religion, and of Separation and Reformation, which ariſeth from it, We may eaſily now underſtand <hi>whether and how far we ought to judge the perſons.</hi> For as far as we muſt diſcern <hi>the matter,</hi> what is ſound and true, or falſe and erroneous Doctrine or Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; So far we can and muſt alſo extend our judgement to <hi>the perſons,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Word of God; which of them teacheth true or falſe Doctrine, to the end that we may know whom and how far we ought to follow, leſt they become not to us or others a ſtumbling block or an occaſion to fall; ſeeing that that judging of the Doctrine cannot be performed without this judging of the perſons who maintain the Doctrine: yet ſo, that we ought not inſtantly to condemn the <hi>erring perſons,</hi> becauſe of their errour, though it be damnable in it ſelf; but rather alwayes hope for their amendment, as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe that maintain ignorantly ſuch an errour, which by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence is repugnant to the ſaving fundamental Doctrine, and yet ſtand <hi>ſteadfaſtly to the fundamental Doctrine it ſelf, and build not their ſalvation even upon ſuch an errour,</hi> and therefore <hi>do not condemn us</hi> and our Churches, which maintain the very ſame ground. Thoſe I ſay, no doubt, notwithſtanding their errour, they may be ſaved, if they do but labour to teſtifie alſo their Faith in Chriſt, by the works of Chriſtian charity and godly converſation: And that ſuch an errour, which would be damnable unto us that have the knowledge of it, if we ſhould receive it againſt conſcience; yet is not damnable to them by the grace of God, who will judge them according to their Faith and works, and not according to their ignorance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe alſo which condemn us, yet if they do it not <hi>out of malice,</hi> as thoſe falſe Apoſtles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and 3. and 4. but <hi>out of humane weakneſſe and meer ignorance,</hi> either becauſe they are not truely informed of our Doctrine and Faith, or eſteem it to be repugnant to the Word of God and the Doctrine of the Primitive Apoſtolical Church; Thoſe I ſay, we ought not to condemn, although they condemn us with indiſcretion; but rather pray for them, and hope the beſt of their ſalvation, as long as they hold faſt the ground of Faith and the love of Chriſt, which we preſume, not without reaſon, the greateſt part of them do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe likewiſe who <hi>ground and build their ſalvation upon erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:164278:42"/> and falſe Doctrine and Religion</hi> (which in ſome manner all thoſe are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to do, who account them for <hi>neceſſary fundamental Doctrine</hi>) and indeed ſufficiently teſtifie that they do not condemn us meerly out of infirmity, but out of an <hi>uncharitableneſſe and malice,</hi> and alſo retain not the <hi>true ground of Faith nor the love of Christ:</hi> Thoſe we may judge by the Word of God, as all other men who paſſe their life in notorious ſins and vices without true repentance, <hi>that they are in a damnable condition;</hi> which is to ſay, That God could condemn them of right in their blindneſſe and malice, and ſhall undoubtedly condemn them, unleſſe they repent: <hi>Finally,</hi> we may proceed alſo with them after the rule of Chriſt and the Apoſtles: <hi>A man that is an Heretick reject</hi> (let him be unto thee as <hi>an Heathen man and a Publicane,</hi> Matth. 18. v. 17.) <hi>after the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond admonition, knowing that he that is ſuch is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf:</hi> Yet we ought not therefore utterly to condemn them, but rather ſtill pray for them, hoping God may convert them yet before their laſt gaſp. For although the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>There is a ſin unto death,</hi> for which we ſhall not pray: Yet he ſaith not, that we ſhall not pray <hi>for the ſinner,</hi> much leſſe condemn him unto death, we being not able exactly to know, nor ought to judge whether he hath committed the ſin unto death, <hi>viz.</hi> the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or in other ſins is given over to a hardned and an obdurate unbeleef and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</p>
                  <p>With one word, We muſt abſolutely reſigne and commit the judgement of eternal damnation to God alone, being the <hi>onely Law-giver who is able to ſave and to destroy,</hi> Jam. 4. v. 12. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth: yea he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand,</hi> Rom. 14. v. 4.</p>
                  <p>Which we now may eaſily apply to our often-mentioned twofold Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: God forbid that we ſhould condemn all Roman-Catholicks; much leſſe all <hi>Lutherans</hi> in general, or even one ſingle and particular man.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, concerning the <hi>Papists,</hi>

How ſhould we then condemn them? Much more reaſon have we to account <hi>ſuch Catholicks for true Evangelical,</hi> and not <hi>for Popiſh Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe their ſalvation is grounded not upon their own merits and ſatisfaction, or upon other <hi>Popiſh</hi> traditions, and Auxiliary
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:164278:43"/> concomitant means; but onely upon the meer grace of God and the precious Redemption of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And that there hath been at all times a great number of ſuch people, and are ſtill at this preſent even in the midſt of Popery; not onely the experience of them that live amongſt them, but their own Books before and after <hi>Luther</hi>'s times do teſtifie it: As <hi>Bernardi, Anſelmi, Gerſonis, Tauleri, Thomae de Kempis, Eraſmi, Caſſandri, Feri, Cardinalis Contareni, Hoſij, Pighij, Colonienſium in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-didagmate &amp; Enchiridio,</hi> and of a great many more.

                  <p>To the Objection that may be made, That they nevertheleſſe went to Maſſe, which we count Idolatrie and conſequently muſt condemn all thoſe as meer Idolaters: We anſwer; That ſuch men went to Maſſe in the ſimplicity of their heart, not even according to the new Maſſe-doctrine, which but in the Councel of <hi>Lateran Ann.</hi> 1218. and after in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized; but according to the pure ancient and ſimple beleef of Chriſts words in the holy Communion, wherein even yet the moderate Papiſts ſo far muſt

                  <p>And though ſome had beleeved the real and corporal preſence and oral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of Chriſts Body in the Maſſe; Yet we ſhould have as little reaſon to condemn them as the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> if they have but grounded the principal comfort and hope of their ſalvation, not upon the carnal, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eating of Chriſts Body, as being the onely Sacrifice and Propitiation for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, though they have much declined in the Ceremonies of the Maſſe from Chriſts firſt Inſtitution, and have added thereunto many humane partly ſuperſtitious, partly idolatrous Ceremonies: Yet all thoſe cannot preſently be accounted for damnable Idolaters, who in thoſe times and places, where the Supper of the Lord was not otherwiſe to be had, nor the errour made yet ſo apparently evident, went to the common Maſſe in their ſimplicity, becauſe of the remnant of Chriſts Inſtitution therein, to the end that they might be made partakers of Chriſts Body and Blood for the quickning of their ſouls: Like as they uſed the Holy Baptiſm for to cleanſe and waſh them from their ſins, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſuperſtitious humane Ceremonies that were added thereunto: Who alſo, though they kneeled down before the conſecrated bread and wine, being a Sacramental token of remembrance and exhibitive ſigne of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, like as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> alſo at the adminiſtration of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and the Reformed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>England</hi> uſe to do; Yet have not fixed the Adoration and confidence of their hearts on the bread and wine, but on Chriſt himſelf ſitting on the right hand of his Father in Heaven: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are much leſſe to be eſteemed Idolaters, then for their kneeling and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down before painted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="4">4. Eſpecially, When they do it not meerly out of humane infirmity and ignorance, or out of a falſe information of our Doctrine and Faith; but partly out of obſtinacy and malice: So that they will not ſuffer nor hearken to a better Inſtruction of Truth, much leſſe ſearch into it themſelves in the Word of God: Or although they have partly been informed and heard it, yet
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:164278:44"/> ſtop their eares and hearts before the Truth, out of ſinful corrupted affections, out of hatred and envy againſt men, out of contention, ambition, private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the like: Yea againſt their own conſcience, obſcure, pervert, and calumniate it with all ſort of ſlanders, detractations and aſperſions, or intricate Sophiſtries.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe and like perſons we cannot generally out of the Word of God judge any thing elſe, but that they in this manner live in a very dangerous yea damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate; not ſimply becauſe of the errour it ſelf, but becauſe they partly pervert through ſuch errour the <hi>ground of Faith,</hi> in regard they make their own particular opinions to be fundamental Doctrines, partly diſſolve the <hi>bond of Christian charity,</hi> in regard they judge and condemn other Chriſtians by reaſon of them. But he that doth this not out of a meer ignorance and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of underſtanding, but out of malice of heart; not we, but God alone is able to know and diſcern him: Wherefore we ought not raſhly to judge and determine of any certain perſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe alſo who though they have had <hi>a ſufficient knowledge of the Truth in their hearts,</hi> and yet will not <hi>openly profeſſe it</hi> out of ſhame before men, or out of other carnal reſpects, are almoſt in a more dangerous caſe then the erring themſelves, becauſe they proceed therein againſt their own conſcience, and make themſelves guilty of the Lords Sentence: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall deny me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, or be aſhamed of me and of my words, him I will alſo deny,</hi> Matth. 10. v. 3. Mark 8. v. 38.</p>
                  <p>For not onely he that denieth againſt his conſcience the whole Doctrine of Chriſt, but alſo he that denieth but one Point of it, which he hath known out of the Word of God, for mens ſake, who oppoſe and condemn it, he hath part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied thereby Chriſt, and been aſhamed of his words: <hi>And whoſoever ſhall break one of theſe leaſt Commandments, he ſhall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. verſ. 19. <hi>For a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> Gal. 5. verſ. 8.</p>
                  <p>They burden alſo therewith their conſcience with the woe and curſe which is pronounced againſt all <hi>unrighteous judgement,</hi> becauſe againſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they call <hi>evil, good,</hi> and <hi>good, evil,</hi> Iſai. 5. verſ. 20, 23. and <hi>decline after many to wreſt Judgement,</hi> Exod. 23. verſ. 2.

                  <p>There we ought to labour as much as is poſſible by fair means, to reconcile the different parties, and not raſhly to judge and condemn the erring: Yet not ſo, that we <hi>wreſt or pervert the Judgement,</hi> or aſſent to the injuſt partie with words or works in their errour, and contrarywiſe withdraw and ſeparate us from the righteous party in the profeſſion of the Truth, calling good evil, and light darkneſſe. <hi>Curſed be he that perverteth the judgement of the ſtranger, fatherleſſe, and widow,</hi> Deuteron. 27. verſ. 19. Should he then not be guilty alſo of the curſe that would wilfully pervert or deny
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:164278:45"/> the judgement of the Church, yea the Judgement and Truth of God?</p>
                  <p>Whereby they alſo, though in their own perſons they might not be inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to condemn and perſecute any man, would yet make themſelves by their aſſent, partakers of the condemnation and perſecution which proceedeth from others, who according to the propheſie of Chriſt <hi>ſhall hate and reproach us, ſeparate us from their company, and cast out our name as evil, Luke</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>To let paſſe how they ſcandalize others in their conſcience by ſuch diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and denying, both the true beleevers, from whom they ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the erring, whom they confirm with their example in the errour, whereas they might have induced and perſwaded them by a free profeſſion of the known Truth at leaſt to a further inquiſition, or alſo to a brotherly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
                  <p>Now although we cannot generally judge any thing elſe of the obſtinate er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and of ſuch diſſembling perſons, but that they in this manner live in a dangerous condition of their ſouls, and even for this reaſon we exhort them, as tenderly as they love their own ſalvation, to the knowledge and profeſſion of Truth, or at leaſt to the mitigation of their uncharitableneſſe: Yet we may not therefore inſtantly and raſhly condemn the perſons, but rather hope and pray to God he may, if not now by our admonition, yet finally before their laſt gaſp, illuminate and bring the erring unto the knowledge of the Truth, or unto Chriſtian love and reconciliation, and move the diſſembling to a ſound and wholeſome Confeſſion.</p>

                  <head>Concluſion of the ſecond Part.</head>
                  <p>NOw by the Declaration of this Apoſtolick Rule, even the moſt unlearned Chriſtian may ſufficiently learn both what and how far we ought not to judge, and what and how far we ought to judge in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and different matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Sum and reſult of it is this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ought to judge and condemn none as Unbeleeving, if he doth but cloſely retain the Univerſal Undoubted Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine of Faith and love of Chriſt, which is neceſſary for all men unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Although he doth not receive our own or our particular Churches and Teachers Opinions and Interpretations, which we acknowledge as agreeable to Scripture and neceſſary for us to beleeve, becauſe he hath no knowledge of them as yet out of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. On the contrary, although he adheres to his own, or his particular Churches and Teachers ſingular Opinions, which he eſteemeth to be conſonant to Scripture and neceſſary for him to beleeve: Yet to ſuch Opinions, which are uncertain or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or erroneous alſo, and repugnant to the Word of God, or to the ſaving fundamental Doctrine it ſelf by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As long as he doth not acknowledge ſuch conſequence and retaineth but the fundamental Doctrine it ſelf poſitively and without any mutilation, and doth alſo not erre out of malice of heart, but onely out of weakneſſe of underſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:164278:46"/>5. As long as he doth not make quite fundamental Doctrines of them, nor impoſeth them on others as neceſſary, neither judgeth and condemneth others therefore, or diſturbeth the Church of God with prejudicial and unneceſſary diſputes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As long alſo as he doth not obſtinately reject better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but rather laboureth to ſearch further the Truth in the Word of God and to teſtifie his Faith by Chriſtian charity and godly converſation. So that he is not to be accounted for an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, unfaithful, ſchiſmatical heretick, but for a weak Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever and erring Brother.</p>
                  <p>Contrarywiſe: 1. They that will have their own erroneous or controverted and unneceſſary opinions to be neceſſary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines, in ſo much that they repoſe their comfort and hope of ſalvation in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which they alſo inforce upon others as neceſſary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrines, or judge, condemn, exclude, and ſeparate from the Communion of the Chriſtian Church others therefore, whereby they cauſe Schiſms and Diviſions in the Church of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eſpecially ſuch opinions which are not onely doubtful and erroneous, but alſo repugnant to the true undoubted Articles of Faith and fundamental Doctrine, if not directly and expreſly, yet by a neceſſary conſequence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They alſo who cruelly and uncharitably perſecute others becauſe of ſuch humane opinion, and thereby occaſionate not onely Schiſms in the Church, but diſtempers and diſtractions in Common-wealths.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And that not meerly out of ignorance and humane infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but out of a wilful blindneſſe and malice, ſo that they will not hearken nor receive any information of the Truth, much leſſe ſearch into it themſelves, but obſtinately oppoſe it out of carnal blinded affections.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe we may and muſt thus far judge out of the Word of God: Firſt, Concerning the matter it ſelf, That we no wayes make our ſelves partakers of ſuch errours and other ſins ariſing from thence, but had rather be condemned, rejected, ſeparated, and perſecuted by them; leſt we may become a ſtumbling block and offence, firſt to our own, then to other true beleeving or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As much as concerneth the perſons, That though
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:164278:46"/> we cannot judge any thing elſe of ſuch perſons in general, but that they in this manner are in a dangerous and damnable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet we condemn none in particular: Firſt, Becauſe we cannot directly diſcern in no man, whether he doth erre out of humane weakneſſe or obſtinate malice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe though he did erre out of malice, yet we ought ſtill to hope, ſeek, and pray to God for his converſion, and commit the judgement concerning him to the Soveraign Judge.</p>
                  <p>Would to God, That all that are called Chriſtians, or at leaſt Catholicks and Evangelical, did agree with us herein with one minde (ſeeing that all thoſe that will not proceed againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nor parallel and equal mens words with Gods word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place themſelves in Gods Tribunal, muſt herein agree:) Then the Chriſtian love and peaceableneſſe would raign inſtead of this unhappy Schiſm, cruel diſtraction, and lamentable deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of Chriſtendom; And the eaſieſt and ſafeſt way be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto right Chriſtian Unitie in the Doctrine of Truth, inſtead of the manifold diſſenſions and differences in Doctrine and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath not onely moſt earneſtly and faithfully exhorted us all in general, and eſpecially the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, to which he directeth his Epiſtle; but alſo added moſt efficacious and pregnant motives thereunto: <hi>Wherefore let us not judge one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other any more?</hi> Why? That is evident by the precedent words: <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement-Seat of Chriſt: So then every one of us ſhall give accompt of himſelf to God,</hi> Rom. 14. v. 10, 12. Like as he writeth to the <hi>Corinthians: Therefore judge nothing before the time, untill the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the heart, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. v. 5.</p>
                  <p>If we had that great day of Judgement of the Lord continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet before our eyes, eſpecially the Divines and Eccleſiaſticks, who before all others ſhould be the <hi>Sons of Peace,</hi> Luke 16. v. 6. yea the <hi>true Ambaſſadours of Peace,</hi> Iſai. 33. v. 7. &amp; 52. v. 7. Nah. 1. v. 15. whereas many are Authors of moſt of the diſturbances in the Chriſtian Church by their unchriſtian judging and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They would not be ſo raſh and ſevere in judging one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but every one would firſt think and conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf how we ſhall give once an accompt of our ſelves before that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:164278:47"/> Tribunal: And though we muſt judge for conſcience ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our function; yet we ſhould not more rigourouſly judge others then we our ſelves deſire to be judged by the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> not for our ignorances, nor for our weakneſſe; not for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faulty word, nor according to other mens words, or traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, or humane opinions; yea not after the ſeverity of Gods Law, nor uncertain doubtful Interpretations of the Word of God; But onely according to the undoubted ſaving Goſpel of Grace and Truth of Chriſt, in Fatherly goodneſſe, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, grace, and mercy.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we conclude with the words of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty. For he ſhall have judgement without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy. And mercy rejoyceth against judgement.</hi> To him the Father of Judgement and Father of Mercy be adſcribed all honour and praiſe for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
